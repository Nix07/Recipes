hey bakers today I'm going to show you-how to make a classic of vanilla frosting this is the simplest frosting to make but it is so versatile and delicious I've actually used this to-make my Painted Rose cake if you've seen-that my strawberry Rose cake and my shag cake all these different looks from one buttercream and that is just so simple-let's get started first off we're gonna-be creaming 1 cup or 226 grams of unsalted room-temperature butter when you touch the butter you're gonna press down and it will yield to the touch when pressed into the stand mixer without the paper and you're gonna use a paddle attachment for this you don't want to use a whisk because it'll let's whip so much air into there the buttercream will be like a little bit too frothy and not really easy to pipe and decorate with and then let it run for a few minutes-just walk away go check out creepy kitchen on Instagram whatever you know-[Music]-so many delicious things on Pepe kitchen-check it out-Hey I'm back all right so you can scrape the bowl down and then just whip up a little bit more okay that's nice if you're wondering why people always-say to use unsalted butter um is if you're wondering why people always say to use unsalted butter it's because-different brands of butter have different amounts of salt so can you use-salted butter okay sure go ahead and do that just probably cut the salt out of the recipe just FYI-okay speaking of salt like a healthy pinch there also let's talk about the sugar situation so I've got my scale I'm-gonna zero it out my sifter and I want to press zero and I want one pound of-sugar for this recipe so that is about a pound I'm gonna save a couple tablespoons but that's it if you're wondering why the sifter do I need to do it well technically know you can make a delicious buttercream doesn't have to be sifted but occasionally you will find lumps especially if like me you have-like an open bag of sugar here but sometimes some brands have lumps anyways-they're gonna get stuck in the finer parts of these piping tips it makes the buttercream totally-unusable for any sort of decorating except for like the inside of the cake the crumb coat or maybe the smooth coat-so just go ahead and sift it out if you want to use less sugar in this recipe that's totally fine it's almost to taste-I thought that a one-to-one ratio like 1 cup 1 pound works pretty well you're gonna add more sugar and your buttercream will be stiffer and you can add less sugar cream and it'll be more buttery okay smelling over here I'm going to be mixing this up on low I'm gonna get a tea towel and cover this up-it's gonna get messy little bit bushka for my mixer and mix it up on low for a few seconds maybe-30 seconds gradually increase the speed-okay so sugar in my mouth this is pretty like crumbling right now you'll find that happens a lot of the time when-you're making a smaller batch of buttercream things aren't coming together as quickly as you'd like just-add some liquid in so here's a tablespoon of vanilla extract and that will really help get things started-okay this is on its way to looking amazing nice and creamy but I want to talk to you about the vanilla really quickly it's important to use a-high-quality nice vanilla when they're making a vanilla buttercream if you want it to be the best it can be-Neilsen masse it's like a nicer brand-rodell's a nicer brand there's lots of other ones too you can go organic if you-want to or you can also use vanilla bean paste shouldn't have opened that and turned it upside down vanilla bean paste-anyways this vanilla bean hill bean extract is like the vanilla beans are soaked and this isn't bourbon you're tasting a lot of like bourbon and alcohol that's this the way it works vanilla bean paste-doesn't have alcohol and here it has all those vanilla beans are still in there so it's more of like a sugary paste and the nice thing is that when you mix it-in you see all the flecks of Anila it kind of elevates the dish back to this-I'm going to be adding in the rest of-the sugar now so as promised I reserved-about a couple tablespoons that brings me to a full pound and then sift it out if you try and do this in one go it'll-be really really messy I promise I don't-know if you can see but there's like a lot of lumps in here mm-hmm that's because that bag was open let's just scrape the bowl down we're gonna go back to mixing we're almost done the American buttercream is a very very quick to make we're going to add in a tablespoon of heavy cream at a time so just add your tbsp in let it mix see what the consistency is like you might want to add more or less depending on what you're doing with the buttercream-that is go ahead I will let this whip for a minute just take it on to medium-and walk away come back okay I'm back so-I don't know if you can tell but this buttercream is pretty white now the more-you whip it you're incorporating air into that buttercream and it lightens the color up because the butter you're using is probably yellow if you're-making American buttercream and you want it to be as white as possible choose the lightest color butter possible which often means like a cheaper butter nice vanilla but a cheap butter because the more expensive butters just tend to have more that yellow color cows have been grazing eating the grass living their happy lives you don't want that butter-that's good for savory dishes and things that don't have to be really pale in color but if color is of the utmost concern to you and you're very upset by this off-white situation happening go ahead and make a batch of Italian or-Swiss meringue buttercream you can click up here for my Italian buttercream it is really really nice structurally sound-and pipes beautifully and you can click-up here for my Swiss meringue-buttercream it is so silky perfect for decorating and it is not too sweet much less sweet than American buttercream generally speaking okay this is done but-let's give it a taste test and see if we need to add more salt or not that's nice a little salt will balance it out pours a tablespoon of salt and who is it I don't need all that salt no just a little bit so here little sprinkle-little blessing of salt see what that goes-they're actually gonna add another teaspoon of vanilla in fresh spoon for tasting and let's see what it's like mm-hmm much better-transferring my buttercream to a piping bag fitted with my favorite 869 tip large open star so versatile highly recommend it my favorite literally I whipped up a batch of my favorite vanilla cupcakes so nice and moist look at that so fluffy-you can click up here for that recipe if you'd like and I baked them in just-regular white papers but for you I will be plopping them into some decorative-cupcake papers and let's just pipe and turn me up that's nice let's be real here-I want my buttercream sit out for just a few minutes but when I piped it it looked like this horrible here's one even like the tip it looks a little bit imperfect so it tastes fine but if that ever happens to you if you're like me-and you want things to look just right-what you're gonna do is put the-buttercream back in the bowl mix it on low the lowest setting and it add in like a little bit of cream at a time-until it becomes glossy and smoother take two so now once again pop that in there get to pipe in pipe and swirl turn there we go so much better do you see how much better this is than this mmm it's better just trust me okay-[Music] go Hajus if you want to make these vanilla
