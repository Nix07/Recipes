hey bakers John can elfin prep your kitchen here and today we're gonna make some easy delicious and actually look shockingly healthy fish tacos these have all the crunch the creaminess the textures that you love and the flavor is-off the chain they come together in a few minutes and they are the perfect-quick family meal let's get started-first off let's marinate this fish I'm gonna squeeze a couple tablespoons of lime juice into a large bowl you can use-lemon juice if you want instead but I like the zing of lime and if you really want to go crazy zest some limes in here to add an equal amount of olive oil so there we go good sprinkle of salt and while we're at it some pepper it's a very basic marinade you can do whatever you want to zazz it up or if you have a-favorite fish recipe let me know in the comments I love trying new things out --we're gonna add our fish in there just-move it all around there we go you can-turn it over if you want to this can hang out here for 20 minutes to half an hour let's cover it put it in the fridge-and come back - when you're ready to-assemble and bake into everything while the fish is marinating we can go ahead and make our Pico it's gonna be really-easy and you can totally change the proportions if you want things more spicy etc etc I want mango in mind it's whatever you want so I'm gonna add in most of a jalapeno I will give it a test-though because sometimes jalapenos are so spicy and they will shock you you can't trust them this one I'm getting a whiff of it is a strong so we can just give it a nice nice chop to wash your hands real carefully after touching this jalapeno into our Bowl once you're done no seeds please now for some onion and I like to use red onion just because the color is pretty regular onions are fine-too that nice once the onion hangs out with a lime juice for a while it'll lose a lot of its bite and just be really delicious you won't be eating like a huge piece of onion a quick pickle I'm gonna add some tomato in here a little bit of mildness tell you something really disappointing you heard that that's not right well it'd be-going without today but you should have nice avocados at home really creamy and delicious we'll have to think of-something to make this special start off-by adding like half a teaspoon of salt-see that goes no it's my doing give me-making a marinade no no this is Pico-okay squeeze that lime juice in there-and back look at that beautiful I my love limes limes almost make me think of being on trips and having margaritas and fish tacos okay let's take a look and see something's missing it's a lot of water and sand in my face no cilantro I love this stuff so much someone else in my house feels like it tastes like soap and it won't be around it it's very sad all right let's chop it up-up chop it up do your best-to harvest the leaves without getting too many stalks in there but don't go crazy I'm having roughage okay give it a nice rough chop-mmm yes oh that's a launcher oh I don't care-I'm taking it okay now we can mix this up this looks amazing oh this is my kind it's also you could-leave it out if you want it's a little bit more salt and that jalapeno had a crazy smell like it smelled like it was-gonna be strong but it wasn't so what if-my bite didn't have any jalapeno in it-okay this goes in here-I got a new spoon I won't double dip-well okay this we can take out and now let's take a taste-hmm it's like a salad basically they clean our workspace off and be right back I'm gonna drizzle like a little bit of a crema on top I don't have crema so-I'm gonna make some with sour cream and a little bit of lime juice and salt-really easy just to thin it out get your dairy in there sprinkle of salt third of a cup of sour cream and half a lime-juice whisk it up and just get the consistency all right it has a really wonderful tang and it's also really creamy of course - which complements the fish there we go you can just drizzle-some of that on there and we'll be-amazing last bit of prep we're gonna cut up some radishes so you can do whatever you like I'm gonna give mine thin slices icing things thinly and they're small make sure to use your fingernail as a guide for the knife to protect your-little pinkies especially we have a brand new knife like this and it could literally just chop your finger off without even thinking about it one more okay I'm gonna use a couple green onions-sprink them on top at the end all right there's one more thing to slice I lied never seen a red cabbage with the exterior leaves on it looks like Little-Shop of Horrors I don't need that much this makes an amazing coleslaw if you have a favorite coleslaw recipe let me know in the comments I am always looking-out for them somebody at the house doesn't like them but I do so I'll eat a whole bowl by myself okay give this a nice thin slice now all of our prep is-done ready to get this fish onto a nice hot skillet you could also bake it if you want to do it real quick or do it on-a grill if it's grilling season and your-the best time of your life I will be in the kitchen-[Music]-[Music]-all right my fingers were all nice and toasty and these are the best tortillas oh my gosh they're so soft I thought they were like completely filled with-lard or something because they're so like velvet pillowy soft unlike most tortillas that are corn tortillas but they aren't mmm shocking now let's assemble this I have a little bit of cotija because we needed-something extra since that avocado was not ripe so sad I'm just gonna split up this really tasty lime infused fish everyone gets like a nice portion of fish no one gets the skimpy portion nice little tortilla assembly-line in the making here I'm gonna use my fingers I just wash my hands don't freak out about it get all that amazing cilantro salsa-there liberally spread it over you want to serve these right after assembly clearly especially with soft tortillas-since all that liquid is going to make-those tortillas melty and fall apart a couple of radish slices for everybody-radishes have a wonderful bite if you-don't eat them regularly my mom is from-Mexico so you like radishes are a snack you just eat all the time kind of like-chips at least in my limited experience-it's also great on top of soups and things to add some extra texture and crunch some of our beautiful cabbage for crunch just be a strategic on how you add it so it looks really pretty-literally the only thing I see is no avocado is my avocado right let's sprinkle on some of our green onions don't think I forgot about my wonderful homemade crema it's a little bit over here and now for a little crumble of that cotija it's gonna give us like a nice salty salty bite oh this is a nice lunch are you excited about this I am-I think it's time for a bite first of-all how does that look I think it looks pretty good everything so natural so fresh delicious look that's good crunchy times you don't have to deep-fry your-fish to make them into a delicious fish taco if you want to more power to you I often do it too but this is so much-healthier and you don't lose any of the taste you also get so much more crunch from the cabbage and the radishes ah-okay I'm ready for a bite well let's-let's get to it we're so delicious oh my gosh if you-liked this video check out my hammock spanakopita it is a Greek fish pie you are gonna love lots of flavor and it's vegetarian but for something totally different why not try my how to make a chocolate cake video my very most-favorite rich dreamy chocolate cake-you'll love it and I hope you get to-make it thanks so much for watching
