today we're making a winter wonderland cake it is full of white chocolate-buttercream and I made it I'm bright on-the inside on the outside and on the top-the buttercream is ombre plus there's this blue ombre sugar situation happening that was so fun to make I can't wait to show you by the by the cake has a kiss of peppermint a touch of mint and a little sprinkling of cardamom-and a cardamom makes all the difference-it is so good okay let's get started-I'm adding 1 in 2/3 cups or about 213 grams of all-purpose flour into my bowl I have a sifter on top of it and it's underneath a scale I love using a scale knob because it saves me that much more time doing dishes and it's more accurate perfectly okay now we're gonna be adding in a little bit less than half a teaspoon of kosher salt-a generous quarter teaspoon of baking soda and another generous teaspoon of baking powder apply equals like 1 and-1/2 teaspoons altogether but I like these generous teaspoons no leveling for me now we're adding in a wet ingredient-which is sugar it's going in there anyways for a little bit of an extra-twist I'm adding in an optional quarter teaspoon of cardamom I love the smell and taste of cardamom give it a try-I think it'll pair really nicely with-the white chocolate and a peppermint but if you don't like it skip it all together mmm it smells so good give it a good sniff okay and now we're gonna whisk it together just to incorporate-everything we don't want one big piece-of cardamom hanging out in there now we're gonna set that aside and then the wet ingredients this is super simple I love this batter first off is 1/2 a cup or 120 milliliters of sour cream-I don't know sour cream is something you kind of left there like force into there so it might be a grams measurement you-can tell me in the comments sour cream measured by weight or measured by volume-what do you think I used to also think-that there was all sour cream in the US because I can't even tell you how many comments I get asking for substitutions if you don't have sour cream go ahead and use yogurt-or even buttermilk will work too but-I've recently learned that sour cream is a whole thing around the world in Europe-I'm very intrigued because I thought based on all the comments that it was really just a us thing because some-people like I've never heard of sour cream is it cream that's gone bad whatever and apparently it's very common-all right half a cup of whole milk three quarters of a cup of melted butter look at that beautiful butter it's yellow for-the beta carotene-which is found in the grass that the cows are munching on unless this butter manufacturer was sneaky and just dyed the butter to make me think that because fancy butter is supposed to be more yellow I actually like the cheap butter by the way because it whips up to be really white for butter cream a lot of people ask me like how do you eat your buttercream so white well there's two things one if you want it like white go ahead and use a meringue based-buttercream like Swiss or Italian click up here for my Swiss buttercream video it's really fun so smooth and silky not too sweet but if you're making American buttercream go ahead and find like pale butter I actually couldn't find that butter so my buttercream today is gonna-be a little bit yellower but here's the other tip if you have that yellow butter-and you make an American buttercream and you want it to be white whip it for longer keep it on low walk away do some laundry come back and it'll be nice and bright so now we have three egg whites-that we're gonna put into this batter-you can use the yolks if you want just have the amount of sour cream usually I would say this is to give you like a nice white cake with that bright bright yellow butters staring you in the face I-could've just use the yolks I might save them to make some pastry cream or I can-make a nice lemon curd vo croak not a big deal though because a lot of yellow butter in there okay into what mixture I'm adding one-tablespoon of vanilla extract and because this is a winter wonderland cake-I'm adding in half a teaspoon of-peppermint flavor you can up the peppermint flavor if you want you could-even add in like about half a cup of crushed candy canes at the very end if you want it to look a little bit speckled and festive now we're gonna whisk this up just so everything's nice and combined smells really good before I add this to the dry mixture I'm gonna take a second and prep my pans I'm using six by two inch little baby pans I love this size for cakes if you want to make an 8-inch cake double the batter-and if you want to make a nine-inch cake-triple the batter a lot of eggs a lot of-flour a lot of vanilla but that's the way it goes if you have a party making a big winter wonderland cake triple that-batter I'm buttering and flowering my three six inch pans now normally I would like to use cold butter because it's less messy but all of my butters at room temperature because I'm making a ton of-things today and one of them is not pastry so I don't need any cold butter except for this so it looks look at this is crazy so don't be afraid to use your clean hands to spread it around the pan-just like that and it's kind of crazy-very moisturizing but you want to get-that butter all the way around you could also use baking spray which is like oil and flour mixed together but it's kind of expensive and there isn't that much in there but it's very convenient okay-now let's take a tablespoon of flour and kick it around those pans dump it in shake it around now tap it around once ready for the next pan dump it out-look at that perfectly powdered my cakes-will just like slip out no problem-really make sure that your cake is-pulling away from the pan before you take it out of the oven that's my surefire cue for the cake being ready okay now it's time to add that wet to the dry and then add them into the pan I was watching an old episode of Martha-Stewart and she showed me how if you're lifting something heavy and turning it over to use your spatula or whatever as like a support okay-I'm getting all of this out of the bowl this recipe doesn't waste any batter so there's no snacking for you unfortunately whisk it up you could do this with electric beaters with your stand mixer but I don't see the point mmm oh my gosh that cardamom is really-coming through it's so fragrant I feel like cardamom is totally underutilized in the US okay now we have a nice silky fragrant batter Oh we're gonna add this-into our pan so I'm going to use the scale to measure it out make sure each pan gets the same amount of batter and then I'll put on my cake strips I know for making this recipe so many times-that with my fat daddy-o's pans this is gonna be about 400 and 450 460 grams or her layer now I'm adding on my ratty old cake strips but you're just really wet fabric strips that you can make or buy these are Wilton and they're like very-old right now and they get a lot of use-in the kitchen they give me a really flat cake layers and the sides are not gonna be caramelized or burnt just make-sure they're tight on there so they don't fall off if you want to find out-how to make your own cake strips how they work click up here for my how to get flat cake layers video it might be-life-changing if you have domed cakes that are crummy the same these are going-into the oven at 350 fahrenheit 177-Celsius I think for about half an hour-check on them watch them like a hawk-towards the end because if you pull them-out just the right moment they'll be perfectly baked no carmelization and so fluffy and tender okay into the oven while those cake layers were baking let's make the buttercream starting off-with the white chocolate white chocolate is delicious but so annoying to melt because it really ceases in a moment you can burn it like that what I'm doing is adding two cups of white chocolate chips-into a ball-over which I'm pouring one half of a cup of hot hot cream just under boiling tea-let's steam okay that should melt the white chocolate right away look at that it's already melting I'm gonna see if I can get away with this and not put it over a double boiler it should be okay-all right giving it a mix you can see it really didn't know pretty quickly with just-that hot cream-I've been burnt so many times trying to melt white chocolate and just failing-miserably so be careful this needs to come to room temperature too so it's a little bit warm mm-hmm it's a very tasty though just gonna warn you ahead of time-there's a lot of butter in here there's a lot of sugar in here sugar-the problem is that there is the layers in between which your coloring various shades of blue there's a crumb coat-there's a final coat which you can optionally also make into an ombre and there's dollops on top it's a lot of decorations if you just want the flavor of the cake I would have the buttercream half a pound of butter one pound or less of sugar and then just do a thin coat around it and it'll make sense later how-we could do that I'll come back to one-pound of butter into a stand mixer-paddle attachment cream it up my butter is nice and creamy time for the sugar I will be adding in I'm assuming about a pound and a half to a pound and three quarters remembering-that white chocolates there too it's really gonna make it nice and creamy so start off maybe like half a pound at a time you can really eyeball it it's just-about the mess you're making how much can you stand I'm gonna cover the mixer-a tea towel mix on low look at perfect-let it mix for a few minutes just walk-away come back later all right-one set sugars in there add in like half a teaspoon of salt half a teaspoon of peppermint extract and a little splash-of vanilla mmm smells really nice now-for more sugar tea towel back on just in-case and make some low increase the speed let's let's take a look this is actually done but as you can tell very yellow I mean this looks yellow right that's white that's the yellow not the best for decorating so what we're gonna do is this let it whip up for a bit I'll be back in like four minutes okay take a look at this now whipped up so much more fluffy kee tell how white that is no really really nice now I will say because you whipped more air into it-you're gonna have to give it a final whip just before piping because it does get a little bubbly words the lies that's for meringue butter creams - I do it for all butter creams I never leave butter cream in the piping bag because it just loses his consistency perfect and time to add in our white chocolate well look who came over for a visit-mwah yes my mother I she's coming to visit the grandkids but I was like come-over here for a sec so I'm making a white chocolate buttercream right now lovely look at this look at this look at this look at that drizzle yeah that is so luscious so it's basically room temperature now I'm gonna add this into my mixer while it's running just in a stream it changes the consistency so much and it makes it really luscious add that all in there let the mixer run for a few minutes it all incorporates look at that it's so silky okay yes she's gonna scrape the bottom for me so we gonna set this run for a little bit how does it taste okay we're gonna let this run and then isn't it be time to distribute this into several different batches because it's going to be a blue ombre cake these cake layers are just out of the oven one is still in there for like one or two-more minutes or more and you can see the-edges were pulling away from the pan-that's your key if you're concerned about it releasing this is what I do-tap-tap tap-tap tap-tap just like tap it side to side and it kind of helps the sides dislodge and the bottom to like tap tap tap tap tap yep yep and if you're really concerned use a little knife and just carefully or run it around the edge to make sure nothing is holding now let's dump it out and see how it goes and nice it smells delicious nice see very soft look how pillowy soft-that is perfectly flat even underneath there's no like doming or sagging and this one is a little bit darker that's fine this is still super soft that last piece just came out of the oven it's always a personal challenge for me to bake it just until it's done so I have had some underdone cake catastrophes now that's so hot by the way it just came out of the oven huh-[Music] look at that it's the best one yet so flat you smell meza okay cool down to room temperature let's get our-buttercream handled I'm gonna divide my buttercream into four batches three of-which will be colored one of them is in a remain you know light yellow and I just want to share this with you so right now this buttercream is pretty I'm gonna say it's pretty weak like it's-holding onto the spatula a little bit it needs to cool down a bit because that's white chocolate ganache so I poured in there wasn't totally room temperature I jumped the gun but here's the deal it will set up to be even firmer than a regular buttercream because that chocolate will harden so you're not it'll be okay it's a really luscious about our cream and if you hate American buttercream this might change your mind-is almost like a whipped ganache which-one has very popular let's start off-with one batch and we're gonna color this one batch and see how it turns out because one drop of blue food coloring goes a long way give it a whip that is a very very bright blue now bad as blue as-I want to go so what I'm gonna do is-take a little bit of this blue plop it into here and then add some more butter cream now this will ply to be my lightest batch beautiful it's like a seafoam green all right I'm gonna keep-playing under the colors if it's too-bright or not bright enough you can go ahead and add more add less this will be my darkest I'm gonna lighten it up a bit-this will be my medium one mix that together all this for one drop of blue food coloring I told you it's powerful-stuff-unlike green or it's hard hard hard to get an ice cream this cake is a little-bit different because we're using a special technique with the sanding sugar-so before I begin building it up I have-a little round of cardboard and I'm gonna add it to the bottom this is sit perfectly on the base and it allow me to-transfer it around and handle the cake without messing-anything up so does cut a little circle-of cardboard if you want you can cover-it in tin foil or plastic wrap whatever-you want and then we're ready to get started for the assembly I'm starting off by piping the deepest blue in the center of-that first layer and then I'm gonna use the ombre and just transition out to lighter and lighter layers until I get to my white buttercream this is optional but I love the effect of a nice ombre on the inside to pop the second layer on repeat the process place the third layer on and now let's crumb coat it in a thin-layer of buttercream it doesn't really matter what color are you doing if your cake is a bit unstable at this point go-ahead and pop a skewer in and then do some smoothing put it in the fridge for-later a little chilling will fix everything-once your cake is all crumb coated with a thin layer of buttercream it's rated chill in the fridge for maybe 20 or 30-minutes until it's nice and set a lot of you ask how I clean the bottom of my cake after decorating and I always just use a damp paper towel and slide it-around the edge after your cake is all smooth and chilled it's time to pop on that last layer of buttercream start with the darkest blue I do two stripes-per layer and just go blue lighter blue even lighter blue all the way to white-on top and once you get to the light-just give a nice swirl to the top and ready to smooth out once more use an offset spatula for the top then a bench scraper for the side if you have any gaps like you see here you can just fill them in with the extra buttercream that-you have leftover and do this until it's-pretty smooth it doesn't have to be perfect because it will get covered up by sanding sugars so don't worry if you-see little mistakes after the cake is smooth to your satisfaction to go ahead-and chill it once more and then we're-ready to get our sanding sugar and order-why don't cake is chilling it's time to lay out those sanding sugar stripes I got some dark blue some light blue and some white mix some of the dark blue and the light blue to get a transition-between those two colors some of the white and a light blue to get a-transition between those two colors and then you're ready to roll out your chilled cake the bottom is cardboard and the top is a round of part paper so I can easily handle it without getting buttercream all over my fingers-just roll the cake and press down and-you are set okay now for those dollops-I'm using a large round tip to pipe my dollops onto a sheet of parchment paper-you can use the piping nail or you could also go ahead and just do it on the plate and then pop those into the freezer to chill once they're frozen you can pop a skewer on and then roll them in some more sanding sugar I made a little mini gradient for my dala that you can see here once all your dollops are nice and coated you can pop them-back into the freezer if you're waiting for a while or place them directly onto your cake finish off with a little bit more white sanding sugar and you're ready to enjoy I love the effect of this cake I really hope you get to try it out-okay that was so fun to do was there some chilling time involved yes but that-meant I could like do dishes in between and not have like a total Cinderella moment at the end of this story okay I'm-gonna take a bite I'm so excited that cardamom is so so fragrant yes you could leave it out if you don't like it but I highly suggest you give it a try the sugar is so crunchy it's nice that-is a perfect perfect combination of like vanilla peppermint a little aromatic cardamom oh that's so good that white chocolate buttercream is divine if you hate American buttercream give the white chunk one a try it is similar but not the same as a whipped ganache if you know what I mean-okay thanks so much for liking thanks so much for watching don't forget
