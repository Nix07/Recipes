hey bakers today I'm going to show you how to make the perfect chocolate-buttercream it is creamy silky rich and perfectly sweet also it comes together in a snap okay let's get started for-this recipe we're using one and a half cups of unsalted butter at room temperature that's about 340 grams but let me tell you room-temperature butter-it should yield to the touch so you press down with your finger and you have to like press it doesn't just give way in a melt let's add this in here if you want to double this recipe it doubles up perfectly for like a giant 9-inch triple layer cake that'll be delicious we're going to cream this up I'm using the paddle attachment on my stand mixer but-you can use hand beaters and in a pinch you could even do this by hand with a whisk or you know a spatula but that is a lot of work so this is the easiest way even though it takes up a lot of space and it's pricey okay so my butter is nice and creamed up it's just you know it's more pliable now it helps helps the whole process get started in my hand I have a third of a cup of a really nice cocoa powder this is from Valrhona but any nice cocoa powder will do it is the main flavor so you kind of want to splurge on this you can tell a-difference sift it out because the cocoa will have a lot of lumps in it there's a high fat content to it it's important to sift the ingredients for your butter creams is specially if you're gonna be piping it if you're doing any piping your tips will get clogged by clumps you don't want the clumps and it's really-easy to get rid of them so just a little-bit of sifting goes a long way you'll thank me later-I've had batches of buttercream ruined by clogs alright mix that in there go low and slow you're gonna add in half a teaspoon of salt to get started I might add a little bit-more later okay this butter is becoming a beautiful dark brown color I'm scraping the mixer down and this is continue mixing that smells amazing okay now it's time for the sugar and the same rule holds true this sugar is-probably fine it's a new bag you know CNH sugar not sponsored but I find they don't have lumps some brands do and sometimes it's like the bag has-been open for a while it got a little bit of moisture in there it'll get lumpy-so let's put this mixer to the side and sift out a pound and a half of this you don't have to use exactly a pound and a half if you don't have a scale just you know most of the bag you can use less you can use more it's gonna be up to personal taste the less sugar you use the more kind of like silky and soft your buttercream is gonna be so if you don't like things super sweet cut back on the sugar but not as good for-stacking so if you're building up a cake or doing structural you're gonna see oh-my gosh my cake is leaning I have to put it in the fridge to chill and harden up and then at room temperature and-Microsoft again so more sugar more sweet-more structure or to the wise one a-fresh bag okay this gets messy some people are so much neater than I am but I am Who I am sift a bit of sugar at a time so soft sifting powdered sugar reminds me of-Christmas because I use a little dusting-of powdered sugar to look like snow and a bunch of my cakes and cupcakes it-brings back holiday memories none of that mess ever happened you didn't see anything okay last bit that is 1 pound 8 ounces or what it's like 680 grams ish okay there we go sift it nice and neat almost almost no mess almost look now for the fun part we're gonna be adding the sugar-in so just take a couple at a time maybe a little bit more add your mixer you can-use a tea towel to cover it up or if you want you can use that plastic attachment-I have three of those by the way people and it's not a fan I don't like it-because it's one more thing to clean and there's always like a little bit-actually flies out anyways so mix it up on low with your paddle attachment you can take a peek in and once that sugar is incorporated more increase the speed and you can remove the tea towel and see what's going on there we go just to show you right now looks like buttercream tastes like buttercream could definitely use some-more sugar keep on going-hmmm alright look so crunchy I'm gonna add in a teaspoon and a half of vanilla-just for a little bit build us something extra it's optional though and now for-Italy rush and now for the coffee I almost always add coffee to anything chocolate you do not taste the coffee-you're not drinking a cup of coffee-let's add in about 2 teaspoons of lukewarm or tepid or cold coffee this is-from a mocha pot so it's really really-strong it's basically espresso that's why I'm so wired every morning mmm oh my gosh just adding in that little bit made such a big difference I can smell it already and it is amazing a little bit more sugar just a touch and we're almost almost wrapping it up here-[Music]-okay it's my secret in the kitchen don't tell anybody all right let's take-a look at this it looks amazing-no I'm gonna get a spoon not an animal in front of people mmm-hmm kind of really nice hit of salt-I'm actually gonna add in a sprinkle-more of salt I like it like a salty-chocolate and photo just an added touch-like maybe half a teaspoon more of this-coffee mixture okay let's mix this up and you know a little splash of cream never hurt anybody could you use Bailey's yes you could oh-we're out of cream I'll have to put-Bailey's in my coffee secret's out mom-all right nice flash of cream we can-actually scrape the bowl down because it's looking kind of crazy it's a lot of layers one final mix let's see how this goes okay clean spoon let's check this out oh yeah transferring my buttercream to a piping bag fitted with an 8 69 tip one of my favorites the large open star really versatile highly recommended this can get messy it's important to not to overfill your piping bag that's how catastrophes happen better to keep filling it up than to have one it's-super full and unmanageable or starts leaking out the top all right let's get-to piping and excited how about an apples look at this how cute is that and you know that's gonna-be delicious okay let's do a couple more just for fun-so by the way I do bake my cupcakes in the regular old white papers but for the sake of my audience I will pop them into some decorative cups over here you can bake cupcakes in these cups but I find they get a little bit discolored and-yellow during baking so this is the more aesthetically pleasing way but totally optional-there we go nice and easy and delicious-can I eat these all right these guys are gonna get photographed for my cover shot putting you aside however this spoonful of buttercream is just for me mmm I mean-a mom whipping it really pumped a lot of air into it
