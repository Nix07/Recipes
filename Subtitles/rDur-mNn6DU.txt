today we're making this outrageous and insanely delicious blackberry cake it has a masterplan buttercream so it's not too sweet just right and perfect for warm weather okay let's get started to-make a blackberry curd I'm starting off by juicing my blackberries I don't know what the best way to do this is so I'm gonna use a rolling pin and a bag and just crush them and then strain what I get we'll see if that works starting off-with 6 ounces of blackberries into my bag and now use your rolling pin and-just crush them up so many seeds-I somehow doubt this will be a third of a cup you will see I might add like a tablespoon of lemon juice just to-brighten up the flavor and if that-doesn't add up 2/3 of a cup we're gonna use another 6 ounces of berries place your strainer on top and I'm using a-muddler just to push the juice through-very apprehensive because I won't wipe today for some horrible reason I don't-know why this is a bad choice okay let's measure that out and see how much we got look at that 1/3 of a cup-I'm cutting up a stick of butter or 1/2 of a cup that's a chill that has to be cold into small cubes now that my blackberries are juiced it's time to strain those 6 egg yolks pop them out-and just strain them to your sieve now we're gonna add in a cup of-granulated sugar whisk in that sugar and you'll see the color turn like this beautiful light yellow very frothy and sunny perfect now we're going to pour in our blackberry juice and whisk and even though we've strained everything we still have little pieces of blackberry skin which give us a nice flecks of dark-color now I'm gonna place this over a-medium low medium heat and whisk continuously and eventually you will see-a change in consistency but we're trying-to reach 170 degrees Fahrenheit while whisking now it's time to add in your-1/2 cup of cubed chilled butter into that beautiful ocurred whisk it in and we can transfer it to cool all right so the blackberry curve needs to cool and kind of come together feel free to make this the night before it's perfect just-spread it on the cake it's all cooled there's no wait time but in a pinch you-let it cool for a few hours in the fridge cover this with plastic let it set in the fridge-to the quarter cups of cake flour one heaping teaspoon of baking powder a teaspoon of kosher salt don't forget-that quarter in a cup of granulated sugar sift those together add it on to-our standing mixer and set aside now for the wet ingredients make sure those eggs are at room temperature don't use cold eggs people now we're gonna add in our milk 1/4 cup of room-temperature sour cream matting in the zest of one lemon into my mixture did you see my lemons I want about a third of a cup let's measure this out and add it into our wet ingredients-perfect now give it a whisk set that-aside and now it's time to cream our butter along with the dry ingredients-when you add your butter into the dry ingredients also known as the reverse creaming method you're coating all of that flour in delicious fat which is inhibiting the gluten and creating a more cakey fluffy delicious cake less-bready so your quarters of a cup of room temperature unsalted butter into that mix I'm going to add a few dobbs mix on love continue adding okay let's take a look I-want to show you the crumb so you're ending up with a beautiful crummy mixture like this this is gonna be amazing once we add our wet mixture in mmm I'm going to prepare my three 6-inch pans by buttering and flowering them just get some cold butter rub it along the edges add some flour in kick it around transfer the flour to the next pan that looks perfect and continue kicking it around I'm adding on my cake strips now if you want to see how to-make your own or how these work go ahead and click up over here somewhere for my how to get flat cake layers video-alright now that my pans are prepared-it's time to finish off that cake batter-I'm adding half of the liquid and then beating it together for maybe a minute-and a half and then adding the rest in and beating for another minute now the rest looking let's pick the ball down let mix for a minute transfer the batter and into the oven at-350 for probably 35 minutes we'll see exactly in the titles below so for this cake we're making a really delicious buttercream and instead of having a-normal American One or Italian or Swiss it's gonna be a mess carpoza buttercream-so there's one little trick to it which-just involves not over mixing but-otherwise it's really easy not too sweet-and like perfect for summary cakes I love this for warmer weather three sticks of unsalted butter at room temperature into our standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment give it a mix just to cream it all right very quick now we're gonna sift in three cups of confectioner's sugar close that back up-and mix on low of course we're covering at the tea towel so there won't be as much mess that's mixing up nicely and-I'm just gonna add in like a little bit less than a teaspoon of orange blossom-water totally optional you could use vanilla you could leave it plain because the blackberries a lot a lot of flavor-you could even add in a bit of lemon-zest one final mix so I'm adding in 8 ounces of this mascarpone cheese and it has to be room temperature if it's not it's it's not-gonna work it'll curdle up it's not-gonna mix because you can't over mix this if you do it becomes a grainy is-it'll still taste nice but it's not-going to look nice now mix it in you could mix it in by hand but I'm just-going to go for a little tiny bit using my paddle attachment on low that's it like five seconds give it a little taste test it's so mellow mm-hmm it's like between American buttercream-and Swiss an Italian so it's a little-bit sweeter but it's really creamy and it's nice and soft this is not good-for making a perfect structured like-razor-sharp edge cake this is for a more rustic or natural cake or a naked cake-just FYI okay so I'm ready to assemble my cake but I made an executive decision-I have three pretty sizable layers right now and from experience I know that this delicate buttercream and my delicate curd are just not gonna stand up to that-much weight and also I feel like the cake - buttercream and curd ratio should-be a little bit different so I'm going to take one of my layers and freeze it I can just use it later and the other two will get cut in half basically so now-for thinner layers of cake and I think it'll be like a nice cake - frosting ratio and perfect for a summer cake but that's up to you you can totally do the-three layers or you can make it's a sheet cake or cupcakes the world is your oyster okay let's get to assembling and decorating I'm starting off by piping a layer of that beautiful mascarpone buttercream onto the first layer of the-cake add the blackberries doesn't matter where and then pipe on a generous amount-of your beautiful blackberry ocurred fill in the gaps with some more buttercream and then add the second layer on you're gonna repeat the process repeat the process again and now add your final cake layer on top a thin layer of buttercream it's moving it out with your offset spatula now the cake looks crazy-so it's time to use your bench scraper to smooth the side of the cake give it a smooth fill in any gaps that you see and then continue to smooth if your cake is-unstable now is a great time to add a skewer through the center and chill it this is optional but I'm adding one more-layer of the curd on top and if your curd is too thick just add a little bit of blackberry juice and whisk it in until you get a nice drippy consistency-smooth it with the offset spatula and it's time for the finishing touch I'm giving this cake a beautiful crown of-blackberries I have some that are medium-and some that are really tiny so between those blackberries I'm adding little tiny flowers these are Queen Anne's lace which are edible but they taste horrible so take them off or you can use something else like honeysuckle or-elderflower that tastes much better I love the look of this cake but the taste is so much better juicy blackberries that mascarpone buttercream is amazing it's really not too sweet and it's just right also the lemon cake magnifico-okay I'll be eating this thanks for-watching hit that like button and don't forget to
