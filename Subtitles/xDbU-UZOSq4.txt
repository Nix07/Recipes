today we're gonna make these super cute-ultra simple and delicious bunny buck cupcakes perfect for Easter or any spring gathering and if you've watched any of my videos you know that I do not like fondant but this is the exception-I'm using fondant today people let's get-started so we're starting off with the fondant part start off by dying a little-bit pink to do that just adding a few drops of pink food coloring and then full twist full twist roll it out if you have one of these tools it's really nice-it's just a little rolling wand with like training wheels made of rubber bands on it so we're gonna roll out these paws here this is the paw a little soft part of it and then I'm using a piping tip this is going to be a number-12 which is like a medium circle just-take a dot out set it aside another dot set it aside-we'll make two paws to start off with then for the little you know puff fingers I'm using a number eight tip you can even use a smaller one just pop it out use your handy kitchen skewer if it sticks we're doing the fondant part first because it kind of needs to harden a bit and each Bunny I think would get like three or four now for the paws themselves a little bit more white fondant this time we're gonna roll it out and I'm using my thicker rubber-bands to roll it out you'll see why in a moment and now just use the back of your piping tip and press that out again with your skewer so handy you can even wait for this to firm up a bit before you cut it it'll make it a little bit less soft-and it'll be more easy to handle now this needs to be a little bit Elin gated just like a Bunny's back paws so let's take our rolling pin roll it out in one direction just to stretch it out now we have a longer bunny paw you can even use your fingers if you want that looks - now let's press on the big circle and you can make a little bit larger by pressing down with your face-okay now for the little baby pads just press them on if your little paws aren't sticky you can just brush the place you're gonna put them on with the smallest little tiny amount of water and then place them on and they'll stick-fine and dandy like lemon candy that looks like a bunny pot to me what do you-think just needs to firm up a bit so that's why we're doing it first just wanted to show you I think it's pretty cute so for the body you need to have some kind of a tennis spherical shaped object I have these cups and the inside-is nice and round-you could also use those little tiny bowls whatever you can even shape them-by hand I'm going to be dusting in just a little bit of powdered sugar kick it around this is an act like a little-barrier so nothing sticks on the inside now get a dollop of fondant here this is about listen a little bit under a tablespoon and you're gonna press it into your glass it's not sticking at all-thinks that powdered sugar now we have like a nice domed little bunny body you can place it on your cupcake here and see you want to have some space around for the grass set that aside and repeat the process per hour however many buddies you have the piece de resistance-of my bunny but cupcake will be is fluffy sparkly tail which will be achieved with the use of white sanding sugar just pour some into the bowl now-more funding here we need like a little tail doesn't have to be at all like smooth put it on a toothpick dip it in-that water little water bath and then we're going to roll it in that sanding sugar and we have a nice sparkly fluffy tail look at that so cute catches a light like a diamond to put it onto your bunny but you will be just dabbing it with water fix it and it'll act like glue-I suggest letting this hardened a bit so-you don't pull all of the sanding sugar off first just let it chill out you could put it-on some styrofoam or a piece of-cardboard just to stay upright or just lay it down and it'll be okay gently let's make a couple more look at that beautiful sparkly tail okay so now we're ready to assemble our bunny buns alright so to assemble use a little bit of water for glue just brush where you want to put the feet now let's add our slightly firmer bunny feet it's really a cartoon so don't worry-about where the feet would be placed in nature there we go and the finishing touch will be a big ol-fluffy bunny butt there we go nice it'll set all be glued together and while that's happening we can make our cupcakes we're gonna use-113 grams or 1 and 2/3 cups of all-purpose flour I measured it on the scale 1 teaspoon of baking powder and-1/4 teaspoon of baking soda quarter-teaspoon of salt one whole cup of granulated sugar you could cut back a-little bit do 2/3 if you want give it a nice beautiful sift cast it aside like-your dreams and now let's give it a nice-whisk ok let's set that aside and now-onto the wet ingredients in this smaller bowl I have 1/2 of a cup of sour cream-one of my favorites 1/2 a cup of milk-whole whole milk 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract 3/4 of a cup or 190 grams of unsalted butter at hot temperature melt it down let's make everything easier that white stuff at the bottom our milk solids because I'm using American butter which is not clarified let's whisk this-up and we're almost done except for those pesky little eggs three egg whites-at room temperature just the why it's no yolks whisk it up-alright had a little crease and it adds the lemon zest into here let's just dump-all that mixture out and then we're-going to whisk it up this could be done with electric hand beaters or a standing mixer but why waste the electricity it also comes together so quickly into cupcake papers pop in them into the oven-and then we're gonna get to our-buttercream so I'm gonna pop these papers in there like a cute yellow gingham but it doesn't matter cuz you're never gonna see them and I'll tell you why I'm gonna use a little blogger trick on this later get in there now I'm using ice cream scoop as usual this gives me is the-perfect amount so skip it up and pop it-in next cupcake very satisfying process-I like this because even someone who is clumsy yeah a little bit less than unmess a can get these in without too much mess and you get the exact same amount of batter for each cupcake this recipe yields about 18 cupcakes depending on like the size of your-papers I have some papers or like a little tiny baby papers and some of-their giant even they've all fit into the same size muffin tin it's so frustrating anyways these will bake at-340 350 keep an eye on them turn the pan around halfway through because the back of your oven is usually warmer and you'll be fine while those cupcakes are baking we're gonna do some quick buttercream action here I'm making up a nice delicious batch of American vanilla buttercream so four sticks or one pound-that's 0.45 kilograms-I think butter into a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment-it is unsalted butter to which I'm adding a quarter teaspoon of salt let's give this an ice-cream just for a few minutes it's like a few seconds-[Applause]-it's creamed up now we're gonna add in-about a pound and a half of confectioner sugar it's pretty much up to you because-it's about the consistency and the taste-let's add that sugar in just add in you know a big clump at a time and then mix it on low blows it up and because I have learned from previous experience I'm-gonna be adding a tea towel on here mix-on low increase speed keep that tea towel on no fuss no muss nobody saw any of this other mess repeat the process okay I'm gonna add in a splash of vanilla and a little bit more salt mmm-hmm add some green food coloring onto that buttercream get it nice and vibrant green if you want you could also use matcha powder to get a nice pastel green with no food coloring-I'm using a palette knife but you could use anything you want just to smear a thin base of buttercream onto my cupcake now I'm using a 2:33 grass tip to pipe grass on they make big ones of this --but 2:33 is the one that's really easy to get once you have your border of grass pipes like two rows deep for the most part you can add your bunny in so just be careful because if your bunny stains things will be bad so if your-Bunny's tail falls off things will also-be bad add just some grass in there to elevate the bunny a bit right so place-your bunny press down a bit now and the last bit is to pipe in just a little bit of grass okay there you have it a bunny-buck cupcake very nice okay I've said it before and-I'll say it again that is a very nice-vanilla cupcake recipe if I do say so myself so delicious really moist you just get butter and vanilla and happy feelings from eating them anyways-if you like my videos hit that like button leave a comment if you have any questions and don't forget
