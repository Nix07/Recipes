today I'm going to show you how to make-one of my favorite treats chocolate chip cookies these ones are filled with-toasted pecans and I think they strike-just the perfect balance between a cookie that is like puffy and cakey on-the inside and those cookies that are like crispy and crunchy personally I like a crunchy cookie but not everyone's like that so these are like the best compromise you could possibly imagine and they're so easy to make let's get-started into a bowl I'm adding two and a quarter cups or 270 grams of all-purpose flour I'll just weigh that out 1-teaspoon of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of-baking powder let's just whisk this up really quickly distribute those ingredients set aside and now we're-gonna whip that butter and do our sugar egg situation so into a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment I'm adding in 1 cup of unsalted butter at room temperature I'm using unsalted-because every butter manufacturer uses a little bit different a little bit different amounts of salt and you want to have a consistent recipe so control the salt by using unsalted butter and then adding the salt in yourself okay-into that bowl now let's cream it up-[Music]-I'm adding in a combination of regular-old plain granulated sugar and then light brown sugar if you add in just plain sugar the cookie will spread out-be really thin if you add in a lot of-brown sugar it'll be kind of puffier and closer together and also have that caramel taste from the brown sugar but I like to add a combination you can go back or forth depending on how you cook how you want your cookie to be so 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar mix it up and then one cup of packed light brown sugar this one I'm actually gonna break up a bit with my fingers because there's a couple giant sugar chunks in there much easier to do this so I'm trying to make your mixer do the work for you tenderly adding those-calories in just for you mmm it smells so nice this reminds me of the ice tea's-I used to make myself when I was little like its Lipton ice tea mixes it's like sugar a little iced tea powder or water-and ice pod 80s it whip it up until it's fluffy incorporated you know-I went over for like a second or two now let's tap this down things got a bit-crazy in that Bowl I like it now we're-gonna add in two eggs and or vanilla-just add one egg let it mix add the-other egg let it mix and incorporate otherwise it gets a bit messy two teaspoons of vanilla extract-okay now you have that nice beautiful buttery pace that you're used to from cakes I could totally just eat this like as is I'm I'm disgusting like that but I-won't because they have a recipe to do-now we're gonna add our flour mixture in and mix it until just combined don't over mix and then we'll hand fold in all the other ingredients-I'm very excited I have to tell you something though-I love a burnt crispy cookies like I like roasted Brussels sprouts I like bitter things so yes I love desserts but-I love like a burnt cookie I'll often-accidentally burn some my husband however only likes those soft pillowy fluffy cloudy cakey cookies that I hate-so we'll see how these turn out that is you know there's there's a couple-pockets of flour in there but well we'll deal with it by hand now it's time to-add in the two magical ingredients that'll make this cookie amazing one a cup of toasted chopped pecans you could also use toasted walnuts if you have a nut allergy or you don't like nuts you can skip it too and it'll be chocolate chip cookies and then the other one is gonna be 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips once again maybe semi sweets a bit too sweet for you you could add bittersweet chocolate chips in or if you-don't like chocolate why are you watching this video okay so one cup of chopped toasted pecans if you want to toast pecans or any nut 350 on a baking sheet spread them out and then bake for like five minutes take it out using an oven mitt don't burn yourself then move-the nuts around put it back in for like-another five minutes those outer nuts will always cook first-all the toast first all right and you go-one cup of chocolate chips whoa all right now here's another hint for you if you can get a metal spatula it doesn't have to be copper but like metal this-will work because if you make cookies a lot and you're folding those ingredients by hand you will snap the wooden ones it's happened to me I went right back to the store and got a and got her got an-exchange-[Music]-I'm adding the cookie dough directly onto my baking sheet not bothering with-chilling it you could chill it make a head keep it in your fridge for a special treat they won't spread out as much they'll be a little bit puffier but you and I know I don't like those-cookies my perm I shouldn't dream cookie which I wouldn't make freaks is too specific would be this thin like super flat crispy crunchy caramelized a-ok right on there my worst nightmare those disgusting-oatmeal cookies oh yeah my mom actually makes you has been many years but she makes this amazing oatmeal cookie it's like paper thin super crispy I need that-recipe that's a good video make sure you-give these guys space because they will be spreading out-[Music] music a little like one and a half-tablespoon ice-cream scooper it's really good for getting a nice uniform cookie and not getting too messy-okay our first batch is ready and we're-gonna bake these at 350 Fahrenheit or about 177 Celsius for eight to ten-minutes or until golden brown on the-outside they'll still be soft on the-inside kind of up to you you could burn them if you want alright out of the oven-just cool enough to handle and I have bad news I did not really burn any I was hoping like on the corner something would be like really caramelized but this is the best we're gonna get it's fine and the sacrifices I make okay-I am very excited to cut into this especially since I haven't had lunch yet oh my god I'm so hungry right what so nice hmm that is like very it's nice and-chewy on the inside crispy on the outside if you want to make these the flat crispy cookies that I would like-just use the regular sugar skip the brown sugar and then burn out alright thanks so much for watching if you have-any questions leave them in the comments-below if you like my videos don't forget-to that like button and
