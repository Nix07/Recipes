today I'm going to show you how to make-these easy breezy super delicious and super acute bunny ear cupcakes do you see this face how could you say no to this face please don't eat me-no you're gonna get eaten let's get-started let's bump these cupcakes out real quick I want to get to the bunny ears we're gonna use 113 grams or 1 and-2/3 cups of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda quarter teaspoon of salt one whole cup of granulated sugar you could cut back a little bit do 2/3 if you want-give it a nice beautiful sift and now let's give it a nice whisk in this smaller bowl I have 1/2 of a cup of sour cream one of my favorites 1/2 a cup of milk 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract 3/4 of a cup or 190 grams of unsalted butter let's whisk this up three egg whites at room temperature 1 egg just the why it's no yolks whisk it up alright it had a-little crease I'm going to add some-lemon zest into here let's just dump all-that mixture out and then we're going to whisk it up into cupcake papers pop in them into the oven and then we're gonna-get to our buttercream while those cupcakes are baking we're gonna do some quick buttercream action here I'm making up a nice delicious batch of American vanilla buttercream-but you could also make this recipe with-a Swiss or Italian buttercream you can click up here for my how to make Swiss buttercream so four sticks or 1 pound-butter into a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment it is unsalted butter too which I'm adding 1/4 teaspoon of salt let's give this a nice cream now we're gonna add in-about a pound and a half of confectioner sugar just add in you know a big clump at a time and then mix it on low close it up make some well repeat the process okay-look at this nice why it's buttercream-very nice I'm going to add in a splash of vanilla and a little bit more salt so-I told you earlier that we weren't going to use those little dainty paper cups-they didn't make a difference and it's because we're using these insanely gorgeous cups instead love these decorative paper cups but I never bake actual cupcakes in them because all the butter will stain them even though they say they're grease proof what I normally-do is pop this in directly like that and tap it down did you ever think you would see this in my hands it is fondant I don't like fondant you could totally use modeling chocolate or even marzipan I think would work nicely too I'm just-taking a little bit off don't like that much I'm gonna roll a ball for the-rabbit's nose so yeah this could have been modeling chocolate I couldn't find modeling chocolate the markets so fondant it is it's not that bad I guess it's kind of like marshmallow but really sweet so dunk this in water really quick-drop it into your pink sanding sugar and roll it around get it nice and covered-now we have our beautiful sparkly pink nose so wait for it to dry for a second-before I pick it up there love it set it aside we set that sugar and now I take some big marshmallows these are like-normal-sized marshmallows these will be our ears here's all you do cut it diagonally and now look it's kind of a bunny shaped ear but of course you couldn't tell that until you dip it in the sanding sugar-look at this now it's magic a little tiny rabbit ears how cute are these-they're adorable let's go on to the next step the cupcake decoration itself is so simple I'm using a large round tip but you can just snip-the tip off your piping bag no one's gonna actually see the piping that's why-I didn't sift that powdered sugar so piped-all up on just the edge and go up kind of like a basic little cupcake you basic-but we're gonna make you magical by rolling you around in my favorite snack as a child angel flake shaped coke at amazing of-course in German chocolate cake but this isn't about rabbit first so light and fluffy fluffy little white rabbits take your cupcake and dunk it gently into-that shaved coconut and now we have like-a free little rabbit you could also do this just to make sure it gets all of-that fluff here we have our now furry rabbit and what we're gonna do is I'm going to use a food-safe implement this is like a plastic tool for doing pastry stuff I never do or actually it's a fondant tool clearly I don't use it now press the ears on one two is that-looking like a bunny mm-hmm alright mmm-sorry eating this fur now let's make another little dot just pressing aside the coconut plop the nose in is that looking more like a bunny now last step-these mini chocolate chips mini chocolate chips are like Heaven Sent for making eyes on things in case you didn't-know and just place those in there till one-eyed bunny okay last eye how does-that look there's a little cute I don't-know I think you look pretty cute hi bunny how are you doing I'll do a couple more for you and then we will get to eating you sorry cut the marshmallows diagonally dip in the pink sanding sugar swirl on some-buttercream roll it around in that coconut add your nose the bunny ears and the chocolate chip eyes it's that easy so I can't eat a Bunny's face on-camera I don't know what it is not a-monster people I can't do it but what I can do is kind of like mock one up for you so I dipped my buttercreamed up cupcake in some of that delicious angel flake coconut and now I will take a bite the coconut I love coconut a little bit of lemon why not oh you got to make-these even if you're not doing it with the bunny or situation make the recipe-and just dip it in just pipe some buttercream on dip it in coconut and you'll be a happy camper-trust me thanks so much for watching if you have any questions leave them in the comments below let me know if you think-of the video and if you do like my videos
