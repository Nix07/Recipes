hey bakers John can help rip up a kitchen here and today we're making shrimp scampi this family film no no no shrimp you stay on the plate this is so quick and easy you will just be in shock by how delicious it is and that you've already eaten it in the time it takes to-make another meal okay let's get started-first thing just a little prep I'm gonna be smashing and mincing some garlic the recipe calls for a tablespoon and a half-or so but to me that means a handful of-garlic because that's how I roll when-I'm making my own food all right so give it a smash that helps release the oils in the garlic you can just discard that skin and now we're gonna mince it up it doesn't have to be like a perfect you know baking school or whatever mints just get nice and small and then repeat for all those garlic's so satisfying to do and I love the smell of garlic there we go now I'll mince it all up do you follow the actual amount of-garlic in a recipe or do you just like-quadruple it let me know in the comments if you do like the exact amount or if-you just do as much as you feel like the dish can possibly hold I'm very curious-because I clearly have my own and my own-garlic opinions my fingers are gonna be smelling like garlic tell the audience not to worry-about it just chop roughly proceeds to mince everything let's collect all this delicious garlic and save it for later I mean that might have been a bit too much well setting it aside and now for the shrimp and I will be changing up knives this is not appropriate here I have a pound and a half of really nice fresh-shrimp they are not however peeled you can buy peeled shrimp that's totally like personal choice and they cost mmm it cost roughly the same but it totally-depends so to peel a shrimp let's go over this because some of you might be a bit scared you're gonna remove the shrimp's carapace starting from the bottom so like basically grab the little swimmer ATS and just peel it out but you're not done now no you're not there's something more important to do let's do all this peeling first and then the next step I like to leave my tails on just because they're like little handles but you can totally remove the tail as well as a personal choice but-notice the heads are gone so there's that I do like I think they're called sweet shrimp you get them it's like how-to sushi restaurant-they have the whole heads and like a little antennae it's Dell deep-fried and-really crunchy and delicious-all right well fast-forward the rest of-this don't mind me just making a little-pasta to go with the shrimp that I'll be having for lunch later actually using that giant pot now for the deveining part this is what they is not the fun part but it's the most useful part of-cleaning your shrimp use a very sharp-knife carefully and make a shallow incision along the top of the shrimp's body yeah when you do that you will-discover not going to call it what it is-but the shrimp's digestive tract we're going to lift that out and then discard that that's trash now and then just make sure you got all of it so you might need-to carry your incision further down a bit okay so they just repeat that-process over and over again until all of your shrimp are nice and clean okay there we go my shrimp is now all prepared before we saute your shrimp you can Pat them in some paper towels as to dry them off that'll help them really get like a nice cook as opposed to steam-but you know it's kind of optional I know you've been a lot of shrimp prepped-already and you might be ready to get on-with the next step so let's go matting in about two tablespoons of olive oil and two tablespoons of butter melt while that's warming up I'm gonna be zesting a lemon lemon zest is like one of the most important parts of this recipe in my-opinion get all that zest off don't waste any I'm gonna add my garlic in so a bunch of garlic move it around and-we're gonna cook it for about a minute-you don't want it to burn you really have to wash it carefully okay see it's-bubbling it smells amazing and it's just-starting to brown that's fine but don't let it brown too much because then it becomes bitter now I'm gonna add my love-deston and about a third of a cup of-white wine we add some sultan don't forget the lemon juice i'm gonna add in the juice of most of a lemon stir it around and you're gonna let this reduce by about half you want the wine to cook off and leave all that delicious flavor but none of the alcohol now that-the mixture is reduced I can start adding in my dry ish shrimp just arrange them on here give them a little bit of space I'll probably have to do two batches of shrimp just cuz I've made so many give it about two minutes and check you just want you really just want the color to change the shrimp can be a-little bit translucent inside I think that's delicious okay the colors changing time to turn over there's a lot of garlic on this and that's just how I like it once your shrimp are turned over just leave them alone don't mess with them-too much you really want them to get get-that heat from the pan and not not be-slippin and slidin shrimp are done I'm-going to take this off of the heat and-then we're gonna serve it over with some-minced parsley and a little bit of pasta-so take as much as you want try to move the stems if possible nobody wants any roughage these days all right and then let's chop it up I used to think the parsley was just a garnish that you would get at a diner when I was a little little child but it has so much flavor it really adds a nice a nice little layer I have a nice Bank of parsley chopped up setting it aside let's plate-something out fresh spaghetti I'm gonna try and be artful with this right now-some shrimps who wants shrimp I do these shrimp are beautifully cooked and they smell amazing finish the whole thing off with a sprinkling liberal sprinkling of that parsley so delicious okay and you can include a little lemon wedge on the side-hmm I just want to eat this I don't talk to anymore but that garlic really-caramelized epic tell you some of it got really dark and I was afraid and I didn't show you but I've actually been snacking on it it's really tasty I like things that are burnt so this is like-pushing all my buttons there thanks so much for watching I hope you get to make this recipe it is
