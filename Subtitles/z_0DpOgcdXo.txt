hey bakers today we're making one of my-favorite treats ever red velvet cupcakes-they are so tender fluffy moist and dreamy your eyes will pop out of your-head-maybe not but they're really good and they're topped with this cloud of cream-cheese frosting that's perfectly tangy just sweet and so easy to make let's get started I'm sifting all the dry ingredients starting off with 1 and 2/3 cups or 213 grams of all-purpose flour into the bowl of my standing mixer 213 213 grams of flour-there we go okay that was easy-1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and a full teaspoon of baking powder quarter teaspoon of kosher salt and because this-is a red velvet there will be two teaspoons of cocoa powder a red velvet-cake is actually the cocoa powder you use reacting with the buttermilk it creates this pink color it's like very dusty chocolate pink that's not the case-anymore most people don't want to see that some people don't even want to put any cocoa powder in their cake but for me I feel like it needs it sift sift sift sift sift and because this is a cake let's not forget one full cup or-200 grams of sugar I forget the sugar so often yeah okay now let's whisk it together I'm done with my scale I'm-gonna put this aside for a moment now for the wet ingredients three whole eggs one two and three room temperature if you can please three quarters of a-cup of buttermilk if you don't have buttermilk at home it's fine use regular whole milk and add like a little bit-less than a tablespoon of white vinegar-or even lemon juice set it aside let it curdle it'll have a similar butter milky taste and feel the buttermilk has more acid in it and it will react with a sodium bicarbonate and make things-little puffier okay let's whisk this together first is to get us going couple tablespoons of vanilla extract and now for the red food coloring I am in America I will be using-some super red americolor food to gel paste well one drop work no.23 let's see there we go a nice realistic looking red color perfect so now back back to the dry mixture and let's get to reverse creaming so right now I have-three quarters of a cup or about a hundred and ninety grams of unsalted butter at room temperature and you want this to be yielding to the touch but not melty if that makes sense just cut it into like mmm tablespoon sized dollop so you can actually seize your fingers and just-distribute them in that fluffy cloudy chocolatey mixture you don't want one giant clump of butter going into the mixer because that lets take longer to break apart fingers are getting very moisturized this definitely reminds me of making pastry but the end result is-so different now that our butter is in there we're going to mix this on low and you're gonna end up with like a crummy crumbly mixture on low just let it mix-it'll work itself out increase the speech like medium-low-after a few seconds and the butter is-getting all broken up right now tinier and tinier pieces you're gonna end up-with like a sandy like a wet sandy mixture almost all that flour is getting coated with the fat from the butter it doesn't it prevents it from being really bready and tough it's gonna keep it nice and tender all right let's take a look I want to show you what this is like look at this mixture-it smells and you can see it's like wet sand almost back to our wet mixture-we're gonna add in about half of it let it mix for a minute and a half maybe two minutes and they get nice and smooth-don't add it all in at once because it's not going to mix up properly mix it on medium walk away take a phone call do your nails whatever-no one can do their nails in a minute now that was wrong okay well let's take-a look hmm this looks really great it's fluffed up a lot it's nice and airy-however I don't know even with that food coloring in I'm not sure it's gonna be-the right color so we might have to add a little bit more just warning you ahead of time okay now let's add in half of the half or a quarter of the wet mixture so another half and then mix it up for like 30-seconds unlove now medium-all right the rest of the mixture in don't be afraid to scrape that bowl down-I will be adding more food coloring in-don't judge me this is optional all-right I am satisfied with that color and-let's get this into our cupcake papers right now using an ice cream scoop just-to plot this batter and my prepared pan-let's bake it at 350 for maybe 15 to 20 minutes to keep an eye on it kind of depends on how hot your oven is you could also switch this around halfway through so that you get a nice even bake and nothing is you know a little bit-burnt in the back keep an eye on it while those cupcakes are in the oven let's whip up a giant batch of cream cheese frosting it's one of my favorite things to eat and it is delicious first off we're gonna sift a pound and a half of confectioner sugar you don't have to sift the sugar but it's a good practice-to have so let's sift it out and using a scale helps you don't have to sift it all at once though you can do it in-batches so sift sift sift it's also good-to get the lumps out ahead of time-because if you're gonna try and mix and mix and mix cheese based frostings like mascarpone frosting and cream cheese frosting can theoretically be over whipped more for mascarpone frosting-which is delicious but you don't want to open whip things Cloudy with a Chance of sugar now we're gonna set this sugar aside come back to a few minutes put your scale away - and we're gonna cream our butter 3 sticks into the bowl of-your stand mixer this makes a big batch so don't see all the butter in panic so let's add that on there cream it up-[Music]-all right so my butter is nice and creamy room-temperature butter should yield to the touch when you press down it shouldn't be hard but it shouldn't be melty either it's in between nice pinch of salt and we're gonna add in 16 ounces of cream cheese if you don't have cream-cheese I question why you're watching-this video but you could also use nip-Chatel cheese which is very similar or you could use mascarpone as well it's-like a cross between cream cheese and heavy whipping cream I would almost describe it as like cream made solid I'm gonna cream this up now mix it with that butter well and I'm gonna add in a teaspoon of vanilla almost a nice idea and why do I put away an empty bottle of vanilla okay this one's empty too and-I'm gonna open a giant new vanilla this is Nilsen masse it's a very good brand-there are many good brains though so if you're getting Rodell that's nice too just go for the real stuff one teaspoon of vanilla please there we go thank you cream it up let it get well combined yeah you know let's flip that ball down-to this tastes delicious already and oh-not above eating it huh why is cream cheese so good all right that's all mixed up and just going to add in like a cup or so I've sugar at a time and let-it incorporate knew it once that's incorporated at the rest or another batch look at this let's just-take a taste-mmm you might notice that it is very like it's runny it's a runny mixture so-we have to add a little bit more sugar-into firm it up and we're gonna mix it in okay let's check this out fresh spoon a little bit wider and you can see is holding a peak more so this is much more pipeable that extra sugar made a big difference oh my god mmm I might add in a little little blessing of salt call it a day that's delicious my red velvet cupcakes are out of the oven and just cool enough to touch they're still warm I want to talk to you about the color look at this this is a red velvet-cupcake if you want it to have it's not-really good oh my gosh if you were to-have more of a chocolatey flavor just-add in like a tablespoon of cocoa powder-or you know whatever you want you could add in one tablespoon of coconut powder-even two tablespoons of cocoa powder and you can dial down the red for sure this is one I made yesterday and I use more cocoa powder and less red food coloring in it still looks to me this looks reddish but I feel for the sake of photography we're gonna go with the more the more food coloring on you also want to have like one cupcake and you can really load up on the red food coloring if you want for that one cupcake to stir it directly into the cupcake batter we're gonna use a cheese grater and grate this out so that we have nice crumbs to sprinkle around those crumbs will give us like a little bit of extra-fun visual cues saying hey this is a red-velvet cupcake eat me I'm delicious-anyways we have some crumbs we're gonna use these at the very end setting them aside I baked these cupcakes in plain old white cupcake wrappers or actually my favorite don't tell anybody I like-that you can see the color through but I think they'll look extra cute and decorative cupcake papers like these you can bake your cupcakes in these papers but they become a little bit discolored-not necessarily from the butter because they're aligned with like some wax stuff-but from the baking it heats them up and makes them a bit yellow so my solution is just to pop them right in there we go-I have my butter cream cream cheese frosting in a piping bag fitted with an-8 69 tip an open star my favorite tip in the world and we're going to give it a nice pulpy dollop so apply pressure-squeeze turn and lift gently there we go whoa that's what I call a spire so we have a beautiful cupcake over here all we need now are some crumbs to sprinkle it on-top what cupcake could this be I wonder our red velvet cupcake that's what this is so simple to make I've been snacking as you saw and it is delicious but I will-take a formal bite in just a moment-let's make a few more-[Music] it's now time for me to eat the sacrificial cupcake I can't I don't know if you can see this but it's so moist-look at this I feel like I shouldn't be touching this cupcake in this away but it's really soft really nice should I eat
