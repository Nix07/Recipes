today I'm going to show you how to make a chocolate lover's dream chocolate-chocolate chip cookies with toasted pecans and a little something extra I'm not going to tell you about till later-if you like my videos hit that like button and subscribe okay let's get started-I'm adding two cups or 240 grams of all-purpose flour into a small ball it's going to weigh it out perfect now-two-thirds of a cup of cocoa powder I was gonna sift that out nevermind it's-okay-alright half a teaspoon of salt-three quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder and I said now let's whisk it together carefully since I used that bowl it's too small so chocolatey Oh chuckling this is a chocolate lovers cookie yeah set that aside-including the scale now we're gonna cream our butter together into my stand mixer I'm adding one cup or 226 grams of unsalted butter at room temperature and-you go you know look at me trying to be a big shot okay you go thank you-you close it up cream it up plug it in-and cream it up-[Music] cream that butter cream it right up now we can add in one and a half cups of-sugar 1/2 this guy has to get polished let it beat until it's nice and light-and fluffy you will notice a difference-[Music]-okay I think you can tell nice creamy fluffy light I'm gonna add two eggs in one at a time and this recipe if you're-making it at home calls for two teaspoons of vanilla extract but I have been baking all day I spilled my vanilla extract there is enough left for this recipe but instead I'm gonna use two-teaspoons of orange blossom water because I think that orange chocolate-great combination I want to give it a try always be adventurous and baking if it makes sense alright one egg-two eggs got it in now for the orange blossom water this is-so fragrant I highly recommend it that's so good okay that is fluffed up to heck and back-I'm just going to owe it's a cloudy on the inside all this butter is like so lightweight because all the air that got whipped in now it is time for that dry mixture so we're gonna add this in while it's mixing gun low stay in-[Music]-st. it kind of okay there we go this yes-I really like the orange blossom water-in here you could leave it out if you want and if you want to go crazy great some orange zest in here zest of an orange you will be in orange chocolate-heaven right now I'm adding it a generous 1/2 cup of chopped toasted pecans my favorite you could also use walnuts you could also omit the nuts all-together macadamia nuts that's an option-too one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips well the neverending cup and 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips get those all in there again if you want them to be-super chocolaty use the full 2 cups if you want more of the cookie cut in half we're gonna just mix this up by hand I want to remind you to use a metal spatula when you do this because it will snap the wooden ones I've learned the hard way-[Music] catch your exercise in there I mean unfortunately with food blogging and then the twins this is all the exercise-I get gone gone are the Los Angeles fancy exercise glasses that's a memory memories alright that's pretty good oh this is cookie dough this is delicious-stuff not gonna eat it though it's gonna go onto a baking sheet and I will be using a Silpat using my trusty 1 and 1/2-tbsp ice cream scoop to get some nice consistent cookies you could use whatever you'd like though this is also the neatest way for me otherwise my hands would be completely covered and cookie batter cookie dough yeah when you go so full of chocolate uh nuts the nice thing about making your own cookie dough too is that you can make a batch put the rest in the fridge of the freezer just make sure it's really well sealed and have OnDemand fresh homemade cookies whenever you'd like-[Music] these cookies are ready to go into the oven however let me show you like a-little out of the food bloggers trick or just like a Priscilla T person trick but if you want them to look a little bit more perfect to just put a couple chocolate chips on top you can embed them in so it looks like it happened naturally and that way when they bake-you'll have that nice glossy chocolate chip top and a little bit more chocolate-you do the same things for the pecans-too just like a couple little pieces of pecan here and they're poking out not covered by the cookie dough they look really nice and show everyone exactly what's inside besides butter and sugar these will bake at 350 Fahrenheit for about eight to ten minutes just watch them spread the edges will set the inside will be kind of-gooey still so let them set by cooling don't lift them up out of the oven just cool enough to handle and mmm they smell so good I didn't even eat any off-camera-I waited for you okay I'm gonna choose one of the cookies-put the rest away for later and let's-take a look inside this is like chocolate fudge basically you know I like a burnt cookie but for these guys I don't mind them being like so cakey and-fudgy that's really good there's so much-chocolate in there well and the orange comes through in the last like-two-thirds of the bite oh that orange is nice in fact if you make this with the orange blossom water add some orange-zest and into you you will be in chocolate orange heaven okay thanks so-much for watching hit that like button-don't forget to subscribe and
