today we are making a marshmallow brownie to end brownies it is basically crazy do you see this I can't see you because it's so giant it's a really nice indulgent chocolate brownie topped with a mountain of homemade marshmallow fluff-and then more chocolate I think this is so pretty - look at that swirl I mean-it's baroque basically amazing so easy to do - if you look watching my cake decorating videos and you're like oh my gosh that guy is out of his mind I like-looking but I couldn't do it make this it looks very impressive but all it takes is like a skewer a toothpick a little knife to do the swirling and magic happens because the ingredients are so amazing let's get-started I'm adding four eggs into a medium bowl just crack them right in no shells though that's not the crunch we-wants okay nice pretty Oaks - now two cups of granulated sugar give it a whisk-and yes you could totally decrease the sugar if you want that's up to you now-I'm gonna get some exercise and whip-this up by hand you could use a standing mixer if you want or little hand beaters if you want to okay that's nice we're gonna set this aside and now it's time for the dry ingredients 1 cup or 120 grams of all-purpose flour about 1/4 cup-of a nice cocoa powder this is a-Valrhona so good one teaspoon of baking powder one teaspoon of salt let's give it a sip that cocoa is really lumpy so sifting is nice it kind of breaks things up it'll mix together more easily your fingers will be nice and-dark afterwards - we're almost done so-what we're gonna do is add in our sugar egg mixture love that color just mix it up it's that cocoa color coming through already Oh Lord okay that's looking good now we're gonna toss in two cups of dark chocolate chips you can you send my sweet bittersweet a combo whatever you'd like mix it up and the last step is 1 cup of melted butter in there this is a very very decadent treat so I'm sorry everybody I understand but you know have a smaller piece that'll be delicious if you're concerned let's just move that-all around that butter is so delicious-I've made this recipe a few times and sometimes has dumped the butter in at the beginning it really doesn't make a big difference okay look at this okay you can see the batter is basically come together nice giant chocolate chips yes you could also add in like a cup or even-two cups of chopped walnuts or pecans-we're gonna transfer this into our 9 by-13 baking dish now I'm gonna line it with parchment paper too so it'll come-out really easily that is a huge huge bonus you don't want a brownie stuck on the pan if it's happened to you you know it's a sad thing okay let's get that-parchment paper out just press it in there you can fold it you can even put a little bit of batter on the sides to let it stick while it's wet or you just trust and believe it'll work with nothing else in there okay and yeah the sides are naked but that's totally fine because you'll be using-this as handles once it's set and if you want to get the brownie out before it-set let's put a cooling rack on top and do a flip alright pour it out for all those chocolate chips can all that batter out this is ready to-go into the oven at 350 Fahrenheit 177-Celsius for half an hour ish you can use a toothpick to check at the center is set although there's gonna be a lot of-like molten puddle II chocolate in here-so try and find a place with no-chocolate chips if you can for that-toothpick test right into the other-I need a mountain of fluff of this brownie so eight egg whites if you don't want to make like that much fluff you can make half of this with four egg-whites is take the recipe and cut it in-half really easy but for me this brownie-is all about like being very dramatic so-eight egg whites it is I think that using your hands is the best way to separate egg whites and egg yolks those yolks will break a half a second so your soft clean hands are the best way to make sure no yolk goes into that egg white where were these eggs and I was poaching the other day the fresher an egg is the more gelatinous the egg white is so that's great for poaching not great for macaron look at this I've never seen eggs that are so fresh all right last egg very-proud of myself for not breaking any yolks you will make a delicious custard-or lemon curd I'm gonna add in a few dashes of cream of tartar about a-quarter teaspoon or so they'll help stabilize the egg whites get this nice-and frothy before you add the sugar in hold off on the eggs for a second you need two cups of sugar into a saucepan-half a cup of water and one quarter cup-of light corn syrup this is what makes-that marshmallow magic happen give this-us a little bit of a stir to mix up the water the corn syrup and the sugar and now we're gonna put this over like medium high high heat this isn't I get to 240 degrees Fahrenheit or the soft ball stage so before I do that eggs back on this guy goes on to once this is getting frothy start drizzling in your sugar slowly-okay so hopefully these will get to the soft peak stage right when this is at-240 but you might have to alter your-temperature and speed keep an eye on both my sugar just reached 240 now we're gonna drizzle it in slowly while the mixers running don't burn yourself be careful-as a very very very very full mixer I think it'll be okay though let this run until it reaches room temperature it'll-be maybe ten minutes or so you can pack it with ice frozen peas if you want that'll speed things up you can also add in some vanilla once it cools down a bit my brownies out of the oven and cooled so I can handle it you should let this set completely to be honest before you try and take it out once it's cooled you can actually just lift it up by the parchment paper set it aside and then put all that fluff on top do the chocolate drizzle and it'll be so much easier to cut later on my tip to you I melted almost a cup of chocolate-with a few tablespoons of cream get a nice kind of very thick ganache which isn't be perfect you could however just melt the chocolate it'll cool back down and have a little bit of a snap its transfer this into a piping bag and right before use in a few moments we're gonna snip the tip off but first the fluff this is my whisk attachment you can see it was completely submerged Wow is a lot of fluff but I-think this wants to have like a mountain of marshmallow on top that's my theory all right let's dump it out look at this-look at this oh my gosh this makes me so happy-okay now carefully just move it around-of it it's that look crazy or silly-crazy good once you have all of your-fluff down just give it like a nice smooth move it towards the edges and then it's gonna be time to add the chocolate in now we're gonna snip the tip off of our bag and then start piping it over here so just big gloms this doesn't look right now but some magic is-gonna happen all right now I'm gonna take a skewer my favorite kitchen all-purpose tool and to start moving the chocolate around to-create some swirls well look at that see-magic and also bring up some marshmallow from underneath if you want to get some more some more of that white stuff mm-hmm well well that looks pretty nice if I-don't say so myself it's like whoa that my friends is what we call a brownie this is totally ready to serve right off-the back it's gonna be delicious-especially if the brownie is still just-reserving a little bit of the heat on the bottom it'll be nice and gooey mmm-and mouth is watering a little tip for-you if you want to cut this meat Lea butter or oily or knife first that fat will cut right through the meringue and make everything a lot easier and less gooey sticky messy okay next I'll be-eating this well I hope you enjoyed that didn't you think when I first started piping the chocolate they were like oh whoa whoa whoa totally ruined but then I put that skewer in and magic happened so crazy-even I was like wait am I doing this-right like I've made this recipe before-but maybe I did it wrong this time I don't know all right I'm gonna take a bite now you'll bear with me while I-chew because it's a lot mm-hmm if you're like oh John that is way too-much marshmallow fluff go ahead have that too and you let's have like a little thin layer which might be enough for you I don't know I might be sad about it but that might make you happy-anyways thanks so much for watching if you have any questions leave in the comments below remember the full recipe or the step-by-step is always up on-preppy
