hey bakers John canal from preppy kitchen here and today we're making-these amazing fruit tarts perfectly baked formed delicious pastry shells-filled with pastry cream the most amazing custard you've ever had in your-life and of course they're topped with fresh fruits washed with an apricot brandy glaze for a little bit of sparkle-and deliciousness let's get started first off we're gonna make our dreamy pastry cream this is custard sent from heaven but you need to chill at first so we want to get this done as soon as possible if not the day before day before it's fine you can do a lot of this prep the day before and assemble the day of it'll be really easy start off by taking a vanilla bean splitting it lengthwise and then just scrape out all those amazing and black seeds place that into a saucepan along with 2 cups-of milk hold please and then heat that-over like medium heat until it starts to simmer like just about to boil take it off the heat set it aside and we're gonna work on our egg yolks take six egg yolks along with two-thirds of a cup of-sugar you would use a little bit more if you-wanted it's totally up to you pinch of salt and give it a nice whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk until it becomes like a light lemony yellow color now it's time to sift in a-quarter cup of corn starch and then keep whisking stir stir stir stir stir we're gonna have a nice homogeneous mixture and now we're gonna temper that so we're-going to add in like 1/2 a cup or so of the hot milk drizzle it in while you whisk this is a great time to have a helper to hold the bowl for you after your mixtures all tempered we're gonna slowly drizzle in the rest of that warm milk while we whisk so whisk whisk whisk-our goal it's not to have scrambled eggs-just a nice warm egg mixture take the mixture and strain it into a pot you can-use the same pot but just clean it up first it's nice to have no residues or-anything lumpy in there take it over a-medium heat and whisk-you're gonna whisk until it thickens up-you'll see a lot of bubbles at first the bubbles will start disappearing and then it'll start thickening unevenly so you really have to whisk hard at this-point you don't want any lumps and you want it to be nice and evenly cooked-once your mixture is really nice and thick take it off the heat transfer it-to a glass bowl cover that bowl with plastic wrap so the film is touching the custard that way the custard won't develop a skin to it and now it's ready to pop into the fridge for an hour or two or overnight you want to be nice and cool to make the tart shell I'm using a cup or 226 grams of unsalted butter a cup and 2/3 or 160 grams of confectioner's sugar I'm adding in a healthy pinch or about a quarter teaspoon of salt as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extract you could also use-vanilla bean paste if you want to be fancy I find that by using a more room-temperature butter your mixture is a little bit more homogeneous but you can use cold butter too and just whip the heck out of it into a nice paste-whip that all up until it becomes a-paste at which point we can start adding-in our six egg yolks you can just dump them in all at once you will have to scrape the bowl down I am warning you ahead of time you want this mixture to be perfectly homogeneous once that's all-homogeneous we're gonna add in a pound-of flour 450 grams and now we're gonna whip it up for like 40 seconds or so you want to become kind of a shaggy mixture once your mixture is all nice and Shaggy we're gonna dump it out onto a sheet of very lightly floured parchment paper and-I want to tell you this will be divided into like three batches to make it manageable unless you have parchment-paper that's Bank this isn't it be rolled out to three millimeters or an eighth of an inch and you're gonna use-one of these guys if you have it the rollers the bumpers come in so handy I bought this on vacation as like a lark-and it's become my new favorite roller-even though it is the least physically attractive so roll it out between the-two layers of parchment paper and then pop it into the fridge on a baking sheet it needs to cool down for maybe like half an hour to an hour you could do it-before as well like the night before just wrap it in plastic or something so it doesn't dry out in the fridge that's important I have my chilled-and look how chilled it is that is nice-and cold okay plop it on there this is-very important lift the paper off and I'll actually just very very lightly like this very lightly flour it put the paper back on turn it around bright eyes and now we'll have a nice surface that I can remove the pastry from without it sticking you don't want it to stick it warms up-immediately these are the traditional tart shells you probably have at home they have a removable piece in the middle that has been placed someplace else-I'll find it later I'm not going to use this I just have difficulty with them and you have to like dock the pastry you-have to like put the pie weights down there's a lot of stuff they want you to do and it's just a little bit of a hassle so I started using these guys these are made by de by air for the-Valrhona chocolate school and they're amazing they come in lots of different shapes squares they have lots of circles-they have ovals I have all of them I started off with just the circles and I started buying because I was like making-a bunch of videos for them but they last forever they're really well made and they are so good at making perfect tarts-it's crazy let me show you how this works so first of all just press down okay look at that that's our tart base it's not gonna leave the ring all we have to do is add in the wall and it's so easy take a ruler cut out a strip and then one more cut okay now I have my beautiful strip of pastry dough-I didn't measure this out like I normally do to find the circumference of the circle but we can just eyeball it so-well have a little bit of extra pastry but that's okay cut the excess off you want it to-overlap after you press maybe just like-eighth of an inch okay so press this is the key all these little perforations here you're gonna press the pastry dough into-them like this and then press that-together like that okay now we have our almost perfect tart what's left this excess has to be cut off so I'll let's do this okay so satisfying this is going to go into the freezer now and once it's frozen we can pop it into the oven I'll show you a couple things first look how beautiful this looks the amazing part is it bakes just like this there's no puffing no sagging it's amazing freezing it is imperative though so this one goes in right away I'm gonna make a couple of-these I'll do a square one next it's a little bit more challenging but not too much should have been more strategic with where I cut my cut my dough out okay the-dough is warming up so I got to be a bit more careful and let's cut another strip out I'm gonna eyeball it alright perfect-strip of pastry and now we're gonna place this really carefully because the dough is warming up into our tart shell for these rings that have 90-degree angles you have to really like mind the corners because the dough doesn't-naturally want to do that-let's say cut the excess off and then just keep pressing down oh wait I totally forgot to show you something for-the other one let me show you to you now though so in order to form a bond you're gonna want to press with your finger or-you can use some kind of a smoothing tool I just press the corner and that'll cause it to like glue itself together-during baking-and you're also gonna again press the pastry against the wall so when you do that some of the pastry is going into-those perforations and it forms like a little bit of a glue during baking so it doesn't fall down and now we're gonna-cut this one again so just take a knife and cut the excess so it's flush here we have our square tart all so ready to go into the freezer huh I'm-excited this one you might have to add like one-little hole in the center for steam to escape I'm just warning you ahead of-time okay the other key to baking these-I want to show you right now while those-are in the freezer is this guy to perforate it can you hear me through it it's a perforated silicone mat I have a link for this as well in the description-box they come in again so handy but hard to find on Amazon surprisingly the whole point of these is that the air will I go under the Neath the mat and bake evenly and also allow the steam to escape so they don't puff up as much place your frozen tart shells onto your perforated-silicon mat and pop them into the oven-at 320 degrees Fahrenheit for about 12 to 15 minutes it depends on if you want them to be like a little bit under baked but beautiful on light they'll still be crisp or if you want them to kind of crisp up even more and get that nice dark golden color remember to check them after like two to three minutes to see-if they're sagging and if they are just press the sides in and put them back in-you'll be fine I have a batch that came out of the oven and cooled down a bit I want to show you how satisfying this whole ring situation is so take a look-at that and then look at this look up-look at the sides the bottom has that nice texture like a bakery would have now I know they're secrets and you can see like the inside is like perfectly formed this is a great tart shell I'm so excited for this process the other ones came out nicely to a little rectangular ones as well that I made off-camera alright I'm going to set these aside my pastry cream is cool now too so let's give out a whip and get to assembling wait wait wait wait what do we have to do first we have to make our glaze for all the fruits for that glaze-I have half a cup of apricot preserves-in a little Bowl adding a tablespoon of-water to thin it out and a tablespoon of-brandy to make it interesting tablespoon in a blessing all right so we're gonna microwave this and just get it warm and-then mix it up and strain it because-there are some apricot pieces in there it's really hot really hot finish-straining this will be perfect for brushing onto my fruits smells amazing and the last thing before assembly is this pastry cream I made this batch last night plastic off and you can see it really holds its shape too much too pipe so we're gonna whisk it up just till I kind of you know smooth things out calm it down a bit make it more pipeable you don't want to pipe the hot pastry cream in there though because the steam will like make the pastry soggy yeah that is much smoother now so I can pipe it fill it it'll be really nice start off by-piping a layer of custard onto your cooled tart shells then a range of various slices of fruits I'm using some preserved peaches I love the color and-the flavor is really nice strawberries-Kiwi slices blackberries raspberries the works you can arrange this in any kind of pattern you want do a mish-mosh all one kind of fruit or a variety for that beautiful composition like you'd see in-a bakery once your tart shells are all filled with fruit you're gonna give them a nice brushing of that apricot jam this will seal all of the color in the flavors and they won't like wither away right away in the fridge if you're gonna serve them later you can add a little sprig of mint for a touch of green if-you want to and there if you enjoy I've been looking forward to making this and eating it forever I used to go to these like little cafes in Westwood where UCLA is where I went to school and they would have these fresh tarts but they were not-that fresh but they were still good so now I get to have the freshest F fresh tarts just for me with the best-ingredients no preservatives let's get this bit the pastry cream is so gentle custardy-just the right amount of vanilla I'm in a daze Hartmut eyes
