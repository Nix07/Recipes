are you sick and tired of having your sugar cookies a spread out in the oven and become these crazy-looking blobs I was and it plagued me for years until I finally got this recipe down pat there's one secret ingredient and it changes-everything you don't have to worry about-chilling the cookies you have to worry-about anything else is basically foolproof and it's delicious look at that edge it's razor-sharp okay-let's get started I'm adding four cups or 480 grams of all-purpose flour into a bowl and I have a sifter on top of it so-I can sift all the dry ingredients together three-quarters of a teaspoon salt and I'm not gonna forget my magical ingredient half a cup of cornstarch this is what makes those cookies hold-together and not spread it's pure magic-and it changes everything forget all about the chilling etc etc etc all those other tricks one ingredient substitution all you need okay into there sift-everything up give it a quick whisk and set aside matting in one cup of room temperature butter into a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment let's mix it up just a little bit before we-add the sugar in now one cup of granulated sugar we're gonna beat this-until it's light and fluffy before I add that again I just want to show you what light and fluffy looks like so you can see the sugar and the-butter are lighter in color they're a little bit fluffier they've puffed up-this is what you're looking for this is delicious but don't eat it yet I have two room-temperature eggs to add in one at a time so add the first one in mix until it's incorporated and then the second a second egg in just scrape that bowl after it's all nice and light and-fluffy we can add in our dry mixture mix it up you're gonna see it come together and we can also add the vanilla and at this point you might want to scrape the bowl then at this point keep mixing okay now you see the dough is sticking-to the paddle and it looks so cool like here you can touch it you can form it together it's kind of like this crazy-play-doh and it is gonna be now spread-all we're gonna do now is add this into-a plastic bag flatten it together and then chill it for maybe 20 minutes or so-just so it firms up rest this would be perfect for rolling out just roll it up to give it a head start and then toss it-into the fridge that easy you can also make this well in advance and just keep it chilled in the freezer or the fridge-my dough is all chilled and now I'm gonna roll it out sprinkle some flour because you don't want it to stick use my rolling pin and just roll it out and-then just like for pie crust you want to move the cookie dough around because if it sticks you're gonna be set I like my cookies a little thick so don't roll it-out to be paper-thin it'll burn more easily that way using a circular cookie-cutter my favorite and we're just gonna-plop some holes down cut my cookies out and now I'm just gonna take away those extra scraps we can reroll them for more cookies look at that edge this will not spread it's gonna stay exactly the same this recipe is perfect for cut out cookies I got so frustrated in the past with other sugar cookie recipes and they give you all these tricks they just don't work you need the cornstarch in there one little tiny ingredient adds all the difference okay plop your cookies out I have a Silpat I really love it because in my humble opinion the cookie doesn't burn at the-bottom it's kind of like an insulator but parchment paper will work or even-directly on the cookie sheet I just-think it'll be a little bit more browned-normally browning doesn't bother me at all but for some reason sugar cookies everyone wants them to be perfectly pristine even if it's like a reindeer with little antler tip so you don't want those antler tips burned these are gonna bake at 375 for about 12 minutes and I-will always turn my baking sheet around-halfway through because as my oven is a little bit uneven in its heat if you're making bigger cookies or smaller cookies you might have to adjust the time you can make tiny little button cookies and they'll bake in a second so just be mindful the center isn't gonna be set it's gonna be a little bit soft-so like if you tried to pick it up right after baking it'll just fall apart but take it out of the oven-let them cool on the baking sheet and-they will harden up and be perfectly baked so don't over bake them they're gonna be almost a little bit under baked into the oven so you know they look nice-but do they taste good too let's find out that is like perfect sugar cookie like just the right like softness crunchiness on the outside the vanilla is coming through a little tiny bit of-the salt it screams holidays and it's not even anything piped on top of them I enjoy his plane but you can also dip them in chocolate you can do swipes of like white chocolate on top and sprinkle-like crushed candy cane or toffee chips or walnuts that have been toasted so many delicious things you can do and I swear it there's like my go-to cookie recipe if you have any comments leave-them below thanks so much for watching-and don't forget to hit that like button and subscribe
