today we're making a very special-Valentine's Day treat zingy raspberry cupcakes topped with creamy dreamy Swiss meringue buttercream roses these are so-easy to make your mind will be blown-also they're delicious let's get started first thing we're gonna do is make a-raspberry reduction to flavor our buttercream and if you desire the cupcake itself we need some lemon juice-but zest at first because that's going-to go into the batter just zest it over a plate or into a small bowl and we'll use it up like in five minutes or less-so nice I love lemon zest in everything-I'm adding in the juice of half a lemon into a small saucepan just don't have those seeds in nobody wants them okay-six ounces of raspberries nice and washed 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar-and we're gonna put this over like a medium heat and then just model it to get all those raspberries broken up the juice will congeal and form a really flavorful red syrup so pretty muddle those berries up after you've broken up your raspberries you can just let this hang out here for a few minutes come back and stir every once in a while-you'll see it go into this like nice red syrupy stage at which point you're ready to strain it and set it aside raspberries are all broken up now while my reduction is simmering and reducing we can start our dry ingredients off I'm adding in 1 and 2/3 cups of all-purpose flour that's about 213 grams if you're-measuring it up to this I'm going to add-1/4 teaspoon of salt a generous quarter teaspoon of baking soda a generous teaspoon of baking powder one full cup-of granulated sugar sift it out-[Music] give a nice whisk so everything incorporates set it aside and let's check that reduction it's looking nice and thick let's transfer that over and get that sieve doubt all right strain this you don't want to have all those raspberry seeds but you could save the seeds for a smoothie or any snacking-if you're so inclined all right now just use a spatula to press all that through because some of it is pretty good shell-like and I don't want to waste any either and you can see that right now-we're left with just a delicious very concentrated raspberry and lemon reduction pop this into the fridge and-by a time you're ready to use it it'll be nice and chilled for the wet mixture in a medium bowl I have 3/4 of a cup or a hundred and 90 grams of unsalted melted butter no room temperature for us today 1/2 of a cup of sour cream if you don't have sour cream go ahead and use whole milk yogurt and if you don't have that buttermilk or even milk we'll do-half a cup of whole milk the zest of one lemon and three room-temperature egg whites I'm using the whites because I want this to be a beautiful pink cupcake and the yellow of the yolks will-interfere with that but if you don't-care about the color just take out a-quarter cup of the sour cream and use the whole eggs very fresh eggs look at that holding together and three egg whites you can add a tablespoon of vanilla in well maybe a bit less let's say and the juice of half a lemon okay-let's give that a whisk-okay aside from getting of an eighth on my apron that's great let's talk about the reduction though if you want to make this a raspberry cupcake you have a couple of options you could add in some raspberry halves just break them in half-coat them in flour and then add in like maybe about a cup or so of them into the batter the very end you don't want to break them up they're very delicate or you could add that reduction in but let me show you what happens when you add or raspberry reduction in it's very-interesting these are cupcakes I made last night with this recipe and I added-in about three tablespoons of the raspberry reduction maybe like two and a half they were a beautiful pink color when we started off but as you can see-it looks like I use taro root or-something I think it's actually a pretty-lavender color very delicate but it doesn't scream a raspberry to me when you take a bite you're getting like very faint notes if-I told you there was raspberry in there you would say oh I taste the raspberry but it's a beautiful lilac color and for-Valentine's Day I want a nice pink color-so no raspberry reduction yes the London zest and juice we'll be using our raspberry reduction for the buttercream and a sole tiny little drop of soft pink food coloring to get that nice color that we want if you don't want to use-that though go ahead and omit it it'll be like a pretty pale yellow color mmm these are good though add one drop of soft pink food coloring in not deep pink or hot pink it's soft pink if you're using a stronger pink just dip a toothpick in it and just rub a little-bit into the white mixture a little bit goes a long way when it comes to pink-okay let's get out-that's a beautiful soft pink but I'm-adding more because when it bakes the pink lessons of it so two drops there we go that's a nice pink last step dry mixture pour the wet mixture in and give it a whisk you don't even have to use an electric hand beater or anything-superfast or that in don't matches my shirt I just realized that wasn't on-purpose just whisk to combine use a-little bit of elbow grease that beautiful batter is now ready to pop-into our pans I have cute little red liners and an ice cream scoop for an exact measurement they're gonna bake at-350 for about 12 to 15 minutes keep a close eye on things cupcakes are all done now it's time for the buttercream I'm making a batch of creamy dreamy and just beyond delicious-Swiss meringue buttercream if you want to watch the fall how to with all my tips and tricks click over here watch it-you will become a Swiss buttercream fanatic I promise you but in the meantime let me give you an abbreviated set of steps to make this amazing new favorite frosting separate five room-temperature eggs well the five egg whites one and a half cups of granulated sugar that's 300 grams if you're counting and one nice pinch of salt into a glass bowl transfer the bowl over to a pot of simmering water the water can't touch the bowl it's a steam heat whisk everything to combine and then stir occasionally until it starts heating up-once your mixture begins forming whisk continuously until it reaches a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit or grab a-little bit between your fingers you'll see that it's really warm and sticky and smooth all that sugar has dissolved once you're at 160 fahrenheit transfer to a standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and begin whisking up start low move too high you'll get nice soft silky-peaks and that mixer has to keep running-until you are at room temperature once your mixtures at room temperature you can add in two cups of unsalted-butter a tablespoon at a time just drop in the first bit mix until incorporated and continue until all the butter is gone don't panic-if it begins to get soupy that's what should happen it'll come together once all the butter is added and you can-except love it finish it off by adding a little bit of flavoring for this one instead of adding a teaspoon of vanilla-I added a teaspoon of orange blossom water but use vanilla or skip it all together because we will be using the raspberry reduction for flavor to all-done so now let's take a little bit of-that buttercream so smooth and creamy-just plop it into a bowl and we're gonna be flavoring a bit of this and coloring a bit too maybe we'll save some and keep it white maybe you will have a gradient-I don't know yet that's about like a cup and a half maybe two cups let's take a-tablespoon of our beautiful reduction-and just for a moment can we appreciate the color look at that this gives you a beautiful natural pink with no food coloring and we know I don't ever use-food coloring alright let's take a tablespoon and whisk it in do you see this-I could blend I guess like paint this on-a sheet and like blend in completely-beautiful I love the little specks you're getting of the raspberry skins - so natural and lovely I have a piping bag fitted with a 125 tip that is a medium petal tip in case you don't know it's in a spoon in some of my beautiful-soft pink raspberry Swiss meringue buttercream and I thought be fun to try some nice roses now for the base of the cupcake I like to just add a dollop and build a little bit of a mound now we can pipe a little spiral and then begin piping some small closed petals the petals get larger as you go out these cupcakes are so easy to make but when you bring them to a party or make it for someone special people love them you can-really tell there's a little bit of extra effort put into them okay there we go that's a cute and pretty really easy-soft pink rose-[Music]-okay there we go another little rose so you saw what they look like purple I really like them pink I can't help myself I feel like for Valentine's Day-you want it to be a special treat this is a very moist cuppa tea can you see-this look at it coming
