hey bakers John can Elkin prep your kitchen here today we'll be making these super acute Easter chick cupcakes these-little guys are never gonna leave the nest sorry it's not gonna work at all-right let's get started-we're gonna use 1 and 2/3 cups of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking-powder and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda-quarter teaspoon of salt one whole cup of granulated sugar you could cut back a-little bit do 2/3 if you want give it a nice beautiful sift and now let's give it a nice whisk in this smaller bowl I have 1/2 of a cup of sour cream half a-cup of milk 1 tablespoon of vanilla-extract 3/4 of a cup or 190 grams of unsalted butter let's whisk this up 3 egg whites at room temperature just the why it's no yolks whisk it up add some lemon zest into here dump all that-mixture out and then we're going to-whisk it up into cupcake papers pop in them into the oven and then we're gonna get to our buttercream so this about our-cream comes together in a snap I'm using-3/4 of a cup of butter from two-different brands can you tell do you see the difference when I get people telling me oh my gosh my buttercream is so yellow I think you're using yellow butter the bottom one is Kerrygold which-is a really great brand but for-buttercream if you're making white buttercream try and use a lighter color-butter let's cream this up just a little bit let's turn the let's plug this in glad there wasn't any sugar in there okay Wow this is gonna be a sweeter buttercream but for that nest and the grass you really want them to be nice and perky-and stiff so a little bit more sugar-don't use any cream in this it's gonna be a nice stiff buttercream I'm gonna sit this out because I'm using piping tips that have really tiny openings and if they clog I'll be sad and I don't want to be sad when I'm making a cheerful Easter cupcake sit this out and add it in several batches doo-doo-doo-I'm trying to make less than a mess-today and get my exercise in it's a shake weight I'm gonna add a guard on what in now let's add the guard on and see how this works out it's helping a little bit although it's going on me-instead of on you keep going with that powdered sugar and we'll be back when this is all done I'm adding in a generous pinch or two of salt and a-little bit more sugar dumps whole bag in-the thing is these cupcakes don't-actually have that much bra sting on them so don't get in a panic here does-everyone make a mess or is it just me-you can let me know in the comments I don't know if I'm just like a cloud of sugar dusts come to life or if it's a common thing I feel like my mom wouldn't make a mess but she also wouldn't judge me for making a mess I mean no a little bit of vanilla for flavor splash let's scrape the bowl down to see what's happening it's good it's nice and stiff which is what I want but the texture is still smooth now I'm gonna divide this into two batches one batch is gonna be green that's the batch that-goes in this little Bowl my little rabbit spatula that's Peter Rabbit on it I'm adding a-tablespoon of cocoa powder it's gonna sift it so it doesn't have any big cocoa lumps in there let's see how that looks-it's all about color here I'm sorry I don't really care about the taste of the-chocolate I need that chocolate nest to-the brown that looks better add some vanilla just to thin it out a bit that looks good we can set this aside and mix up our green batch now just going to look for the right green and we got him covered in chocolate huh well that's just adding some green there just a couple drops I'm gonna fold it in and then I'm gonna start mixing it all right now we're gonna set this buttercream aside and work on our little baby chicks-dying a small batch of fondant up a-little bit of yellow and I'm wearing gloves because this can get messy and I don't want to have yellow hands thank-you so just add your color in there and-just keep folding it and stretching it-that's my best advice to color this up there we go-tweetybird yellow that's what the chicks are gonna be to cover that in plastic and set it aside you can make the chicks in advance and in fact you should really-make the beak part in advance so do that in the morning you're gonna start or the night before just cover it in plastic-but you have to let them air out because the beaks need to be a bit dry so for the heads you're gonna measure out about a teaspoon and if you're gonna use a-scale that ends up being around three grams roll them out don't be afraid to like really get them rolled because you don't want any wrinkles on the head and set them down-one down now your chick size can be whatever color you like an easy way to-do this and a hard way to do this I used to do it by like taking one sprinkle on my finger and then putting it onto the bird's head that doesn't work so here's what you're gonna do let's sort out some-of the dark ones so place a dark sprinkle down in a dark sprinkle of a matching color down and set them basically as far apart as you think they should be on the bird's head now take your clean fingers that don't have any food coloring on them and you're gonna press the head into the eyes down here and there you go look at that almost done just the beak is left that's the-easiest way to do it trust an expert-look how cute that is alright now for-the beak so I colored and rolled out-this fondant yesterday and I just-covered it in plastic after it was sitting out for an hour it's dry on one side wet on the other and that's fine-I'm shocked that it's still so wet I hoped it was gonna dry out a bit more so-really you can make this part like a day or two ahead of time and it's gonna be-totally fine for the beak this is so easy you're gonna be shocked you're gonna cut a strip of this fondant out-it's maybe about a quarter of an inch-and then make it a parallelogram so maybe a 30-degree angle and then you're gonna press it down in middle with a dull side of the knife fold it over like-that what's this a little baby beak hey beak okay and then just press that into the face there you can use the dull side of the knife once again if you want that's a cute little baby bird hey baby bird press the head down into those little tiny eyes now it's all set and-ready for the beak I had two begun using-a toothpick press lightly and it'll adhere smooth a thin layer of buttercream on top and now pipe that grass I'm using a small grass tip but you can use a large grass tip or 2:59 like I used for the nest itself piping that nest is so satisfying by the way pop those heads on and you're done you can also pipe the grass on with a large tip as well it doesn't look as nice but it's so much faster those were fun to make I have been making an assembly line of these though because-I'm actually gonna be on home and family-tomorrow it's a show that's on the-Hallmark Channel and I'm making these they requested them so it's been like-Easter chick Factory in here I
