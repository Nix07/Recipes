hey bakers John canal from preppy kitchen here today we're making this decadent chocolate lava cake it is so easy comes together in less than 20-minutes and I mean this is a chocolate-lover's dream let's get started first off let's prep our little ramekins or custard dishes all I have to do is just wipe them with butter on the inside wipe-like well I already wiped these why am I-doing it again this one was fresh and clean for you okay so just butter the inside you want these term release you don't want them to stick if they stick-all that lava is gonna come pouring out what was the point that's not romantic-alright last one I have one big one I want to test and see what it's like-these are super rich so the portion size-is smaller than you might expect-okay now just tap in a little bit of flour your table spoon kick it around just as though you're buttering and-flowering a cake pan and then tap the-excess out and continue the process now that our ramekins are prepared we-can melt our chocolate and butter I have-six ounces of a nice bittersweet chocolate that's about a cup or if you're measuring it in grams it's about a hundred eighty eight one stick of unsalted butter at room temperature-plopped right in there so elegant I could be in the ballet all right now we're gonna microwave this in a couple bursts and the butter will melt first-and we'll warm that up and then we'll just whisk it up while that's in the microwave let's get two eggs and two egg yolks and a whole lot of shell hello I hate how some eggs are like full of-membranes so you can't pry them apart-while other eggs just fall apart in-instance it's one of my pet peeves one egg yolk - egg yolks set those whites aside you can make a meringue later-maybe some macaron our butter has melted-and I don't want to burn the chocolate-let's just put that there-I'm adding half a teaspoon of instant espresso in here it's totally optional-but as you might know a little bit of coffee brings out a lot of chocolate flavor let's give us a whisk and see where we're at I love the way a chocolate-ganache comes to together it goes from being black to-this gorgeous silky amazing okay it's chocolates all nice and melty very beautiful let's deal with the eggs now I have my two eggs and two yolks in here-I'm adding in like maybe almost half a teaspoon of salt I like my chocolate to be very salty so if you want to have less a pinch is fine we're gonna whisk this up and I'm gonna do it by hand because I need the exercise okay but now we're gonna add a quarter cup of sugar in and really whisk it up so that it's nice and like a lemony yellow color man should use the Machine you know what we can use the Machine I tried to be a big-shot it work now-[Music] yeah that was not gonna work by hand-what was I thinking we have this nice-beautiful light lemon colored mixture-it's time to fold in our silky chocolate-flourless chocolate cakes are just you know chocolate and egg and butter-basically held together with the-smallest amount of flour possible let's fold that in and now for the flour you-use about two tablespoons maybe two and-a half and mix sprinkle it in and mix so now our batter is all done you can see it is like a very rich silky chocolate batter tastes amazing like so much chocolate let's pour the batter into our-prepared dishes beside try and be neat-although it's not so easy I tell you if you have a secret hint for pouring batter like this let me know in the comments you're gonna bake these at 450 you're gonna make these at 450 for about-812 minutes but it really depends on your ramekin size if you're using small ramekins you might want to bake for like-seven minutes six minutes it really-depends on how much batter is in there I would do a test batch first let your cakes cool for just a minute in the-ramekin and then place a plate over it invert onto the plate be careful it's very hot remove the ramekin give it a light dusting of powdered sugar you could do-anything you want even put ice cream-directly on top I'm adding a scoop just to the side garnish with a strawberry if desired and enjoy alright let's take a bite-we're not there's like made out of-chocolate dream clouds it's close to a-chocolate souffle because there's almost no flour in there a lot of like Airy lightness but it's pure rich chocolate-inside it's beyond oh my gosh hmm all-right if you like this video why not check out my German chocolate cake it is so delicious it takes longer I'm not gonna lie but it beads a huge number of people and it's a special occasion and for something totally different how about my cake decorating video it's already over a million views as I say this and it is really entertaining to-watch check it out if you like my videos-hit that like button and subscribe
