hey bakers I'm John Cannell and today on preppy kitchen we're making banana bread-if you have ripe bananas this is what you need to make and if you don't you can ripen them in ten minutes with an easy hack it's the first thing-I'm going to show you so let's get started banana bread is the perfect thing to make when you have overly ripe-really brown soft bananas but what if you want this delicious treat when you have regular bananas the solution is just to pop them into the oven on a baking sheet like this 350 Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes or until they turn black they look really gross on the outside but on the inside they'll be nice and gooey and perfect for your-batter so these guys are regular ripe delicious bananas they need to go into the oven right now-while US bananas are ripening in the oven I'm going to sift together all my dry ingredients so they are ready when I-need them starting off with one and-three-quarter cups or 215 grams about of all-purpose flour yes that was my best pour ever no editing needed for that okay a teaspoon-of baking powder teaspoon of baking soda-you can spice your bread however you'd like I love all the spices so starting-off with one teaspoon of cinnamon this doesn't fit inside all right-problem-solve about a teaspoon of-cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of allspice one of my favorites I'm adding an up hint of cardamom love the smell last spice nutmeg I used to always use powdered nutmeg and be like oh those snobs if-they're micro planing of nutmeg nuts but it actually makes a huge difference it's so much fresher and zinger if you have a microplane-these guys come in handy the brand name is actually microplane I don't if they invented it but life do is just I don't measure it I just do like you know I know maybe like half a teaspoon no-quarter teaspoon large generous pinch whatever you want ah it's so nice did you know that nutmeg is actually a hallucinogen-I think it's poisonous too but that's like if you eat like a ton of nutmeg nuts-all right sift it up give it a whisk I'm removing my scale I know it bothers people and now it's time for the creaming of the fats in this recipe I'm using a-quarter cup of unsalted butter at room temperature you could use a full half of a cup of unsalted butter at room temperature but I am using quarter cup of butter and a quarter cup of coconut oil two of my favorites and aside from-being able to do anything and it's magical I like the subtle taste it adds and it's a healthy fat than butter-because it's a medium chain fatty acid I know it's controversial but it's a-little bit better it's still fat okay-cream it up it'll take a little while-because the coconut needs to get worked a bit once your fats are creamed up you can add in 3/4 of a cup of regular granulated sugar-[Applause] hush once here once you're all nice and-creamy fluffy time to add in two large eggs one at a time just crack them in no shells let them incorporate and then add the other one in that's looking good but I have to scrape my bowl down egg number two-[Music] well whoa why did I do that ah sorry it-tastes good though so now it's time to-add in about two tablespoons of yogurt a teaspoon of vanilla which I'm actually gonna measure out mix that up and now let's go back to those bananas which should be cool enough to touch yeah Oh-cool enough to touch all right let's cut those bananas open a little banana surgery look at this do you see do you-see this gooey banana I would not like to eat this this is like my nightmare of bananas but it's perfect it is perfect for our banana bread it's like I wouldn't want to eat stale bread but stale bread is so good for you no-croutons and bread pudding these are like nightmare bananas woof imagine-opening at a lunch box and getting one of those okay now we're gonna mash them up you can use whatever you want I'm-using a potato masher now I have a banana slurry which is gonna be-excellent for folding into my batter I'm-gonna let this cool down for a few minutes and in the meantime I'll do some dishes while my bananas are cooling down-I'm gonna be prepping the tin you could-really just grease your tin pop the batter in but if you want things to come out really easily just make a handle out of parchment paper this is a 9 by 4 this-is a line by 4 tin little things in life-okay this is an I'm important and I'm-going to be measuring at about 9 inches wide just fold that over okay it doesn't have to be perfect you don't worry about-it if it's not and then let's use our knife okay you can grease the inside of the baking tin just a little bit so the paper sticks crease the small sides and then just pop it in this is a batter that will hold together pretty easily so it's really just about lifting it out-and transferring over to a cooling rack-without like manhandling it or marring the surface at the top because we're gonna do something nice to the top fold-that over there and now we can add in just a little bit more baking spray but not really necessary and now the batter is ready to come together because those bananas have cooled down can you tell what just disappeared from the background let me know in the comments if you have an eagle eye you spotted it okay now we're gonna add in our room temperature banana mush it's a technical term it's about oh it's about a cup and a half it's three medium big bananas mix it up now we're ready to add in our dry mixture really-fast and easy go on low and just mix until combined you don't want this to get too too cakey you know what I mean-if you want to add a cup and a half of toasted pecans or walnuts that would be an amazing idea I seriously considered-it but I feel like ice add nuts to everything and I've been getting comments I can smell all those spices this is delicious-alright that's good I'm gonna mix it up by hand just to make sure everything got-incorporated on the bottom and then we can get this into the pan and I'll show-you my special trick for making this-look a little bit prettier yeah so on the bottom of the bowl there's a bunch of stuff that didn't get mixed in I know you could use a scraping attachment I kind of love mine but I've had really-bad like flour blow ups with it so I'm just leaving it in the drawer for now-okay there we go we have some like nice-small chunks of banna hanging on there I know if you can see it but they're gonna add a lot of like nice super moist pockets into the bread you get this batter in to our pan right now little-love a lot drain baking so don't worry-too much if there's a clump here or there but you can totally help things along if you feel like it I feel like it so I will just be helping things along with my spatula just even it out of it it'll rise a bunch as well so this could go into the oven right now you could decorate it with some toasted pecans or walnuts you know chocolate chips coconut-whatever you feel like but I will be doing a food blogger classic which is a-half banana on top and I want to show you how you make it look real pretty set it aside for a minute and let's take out a sheet of parchment paper or a plate whatever you want a banana not the ultra ripe bananas we used for the batter and a bit of brown sugar it could be light or dark doesn't matter sprinkle it on the paper the paper is just so I can put the rest of the sugar back later and I don't waste it so banana peel it up and now we're gonna cut it in half down the middle so carefully cut it in half don't let your-kids see this this is not how you cut things you have a nice gooey slide you're gonna place this facedown on the brown sugar you can tap a little bit more to get better coverage this isn't to become a brûléed banana in the oven it'll get nice and caramelized and look really pretty so let's get these onto-the banana bread you're gonna add in one like this and then the other banana is gonna go in the opposite direction don't worry about pressing it in they will sink a little bit and actually the batter will rise around them it's not-gonna have that crazy domed top it's going to be much flatter because of the bananas all right into an oven set at-350 degrees Fahrenheit about 177 Celsius if my calculations are correct and it'll bake for 55 minutes here there you're gonna want to take it out take a look at it do the skewer test see if it comes-out clean it might need 5 minutes more who knows okay all right that was so satisfying to make I really hope you get to make this if there's a special hack that you have for your banana bread
