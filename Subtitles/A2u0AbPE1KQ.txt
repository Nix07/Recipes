today we're making one of my all-time favorite cakes German chocolate cake-named after Samuel German not the-country it is the most tender amazing like delicate chocolate cake it just melts in your mouth but it's sandwiched between these insanely delicious layers of like a caramel toasted pecan coconut frosting that is just beyond the beyond-let's get started first off we're gonna prep our pans this is a very tender-delicate delicious cake but it can fall-apart when it's plopping out especially-since it's a big 8-inch pan you are gonna want to use a round of parchment paper and just make your own put that pan down trace around fold your paper in half and you're gonna cut just inside of your line one you don't any pencil that you're eating and two it's gonna fit comfortably inside the pan with no wrinkling there we go it does not have to be perfect no one's gonna notice it's really just going to keep your cake together when it plops out of the pan you can use butter and flour or today-you can take a shortcut and use baking spray this stuff is hilarious by the way it's like a generic brand I think but it's pure oil in here it says zero fat zero calories blah blah blah because the serving size is a third of a second burst this is the serving size actually that was like half a second so be-careful when you do label like a little hint for you today-all right spray the inside of the pan especially the sides put that parchment-paper on there press down a little bit more spray just repeat that process-until you're all done if you're buttering and flowering your pans really just flower the sides really well a little bit of butter to hold the parchment paper down and then some more-butter on top it's like coal miners lung but with baking spray okay there we go those are-all ready and now we can make that batter first off we're gonna get that dry ingredient into our large bowl for the dry ingredients I'm starting off with two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour that is about 270-grams if you're measuring up like I am-200 and yeah 270 grams half a teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of baking soda-quarter teaspoon of baking powder and you go and I'm adding in one tablespoon-of cocoa powder this is optional I like a little bit more chocolate on my cake but a German chocolate cake is actually a very light chocolate almost like a red-velvet cake very light chocolate from that sweet bakers German chocolate all right one tablespoon and you go sift it up all those lumps okay now whisk it up once everything is combined set it aside and it's on to the-chocolate-[Music] nearly all the chocolate flavor from this cake is coming from Germans sweet-chocolate not sponsored but a German chocolate cake is literally just a-chocolate cake made I think in the-1800's to promote this type of chocolate from Baker's chocolate company made by-Samuel German so that's why it's called a German chocolate cake I should get a-lot of comments from people saying this isn't a German cake why are you calling-it German chocolate cake that's no such thing but the guy's name was German there you go four ounces we're gonna chop it up-really finely because I'm gonna melt it with some nice hot coffee-half a cup this chocolate is really delicious by the way I've been nibbling-on it seems like a sweet dark chocolate-really nice-okay once your chocolates all chopped up-plop it into like a medium bowl carefully this is a little awkward-mm-hmm and now half a cup of a hot hot coffee the goal is to not have to use a double boiler with a microwave and then pour that on top clean the counter up-and set it aside after it's sat for like maybe 30 seconds or so we can whisk it-up see what's gonna happen this chocolate actually has like a little bit of a coconut flavor I don't know if it's-just meat conditioned to like expect that frosting but it's really-interesting as a nice flavor I'm surprised because it's not like a fancy-European chocolate company it's like-baker's chocolate that you get in a supermarket okay that's nice a couple lumps are left over they're gonna melt-and if they don't I could pop it to the microwave for 30 seconds and it'll fix everything but for now we can set this aside and get on to the other parts of the batter I'm adding one and a quarter cups of unsalted room-temperature butter into my stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment we're gonna cream it up and then add our sugar in so let's get it nice and creamy first-[Music] that butter looks great to me so I have-two cups of sugar here but I'm reserving-1/4 of a cup for later so separate that out and let's drizzle the sugar in until we have a nice fluffy mixture-[Music]-[Music] this looks nice light and fluffy to me-let's scrape it down and then move on to-the next step so what I'm gonna do is separate my eggs on the fly this would be for the whites the yolks will go-straight in there one at a time while the mixer is running and we're gonna do-it gracefully and nothing wrong is gonna happen here there will be no yolks and my whites no shells either whoo already had a broken yolk this isn't voting well-boom egg number two yeah number three for you can add one and a half teaspoons of vanilla in right now it's about half a-tablespoon scrape that ball down this looks-delicious to me just checking back with-my chocolate ganache mixture it's a very thin ganache it looks like everything-melted together it smells it smells so-good my gosh what is this magical chocolate I'm going to pour this in while the mixer is running and well-all right let me scrape the top down since that was crazy I knew I shouldn't have done that but I put it high anyways-ah that's called self-sabotage yeah we can get that because there's a lot of-unmixed stuff you're hanging around okay now let's give it one more mix just to make sure everything's all together and then we will start adding our dry mixture in as well all right so this is-on those situations we're gonna add in a little bit the dry a little bit a little bit a little bit of the dry a little bit-of that rest of the dry and you're done so mix it back and forth roughly in thirds I guess thirds and halves on low don't spill one cup of buttermilk by the way a little bit more flour rest of the buttermilk me don't spill buttermilk spills-alright last bit of flour you go use your spatula and just you know see what's happening inside of that bowl-there's gonna be some flour up on top-maybe some unmixed parts on the bottom but don't worry about it because right now it's time to do those egg whites-into a clean bowl with a clean whist we're gonna add those egg whites now-there you go whisk it up slowly then increase the speed as they get frothy right and as those eggs froth up we can drizzle our quarter cup of reserved sugar in-[Music]-[Applause] and we're gonna take this to the soft peak stage-all right let's take a look whoa very nice that is a very perky peak but I'm still calling us off-[Music] almost done now it's time to take some-this beautiful fluffy egg white mixture-I'm gonna take maybe a cup of it and just mix it in really fast to lighten-this batter a bit and then we're gonna fold the rest in this batter is so dreamy oh my gosh I would eat this raw and by wood I mean I have several times okay that's good now take all those egg whites out and it's time to fold when we fold go down through the bottom and then cut into the middle so down into the middle down cut into the middle you can move the bowl around a bit but the idea is that you're not crushing all those little egg white bubbles many of them-are getting crushed but you know like-those baby sea turtles some of them are gonna make it-[Music]-[Applause]-okay and after a little bit of careful folding we end up with this this like amazing light fluffy chocolate batter it is so heavenly there we go I am fully-satisfied with the consistency if it's batter and now it is gonna be time to divide it evenly I will be using a scale though because it's hard to tell with this batter it's not really liquidy it's gonna be a mound you have to shake it-around so so I think it's probably be about maybe four hundred and change grams each let's see that's 450 okay-more it's more than 455 about 500 okay yeah it's about 500 and change per pan-if you're measuring it out just make sure you zero out your scale before you put the batter in but after the pans on-so you can see all I'm going to do is let's kind of tap it around a bit just so it spreads out a little bit before I-put into the oven it's not the end of-the world though it'll little self level-I'm adding some baking strips on so you get a nice flat cake layer if you want to learn more about baking strips click over there for my how to get black cake-letters video it is my most popular video ever because people love flat cakes for stacking so much easier when they're not domed although it cuts down-on the snacking for all those all those-cake domes you're gonna cut off all-right into the oven 350 for about half an hour you might want to try moving the pans around if your oven has a hot spot-but try and let them sit in the oven-without disturbing them because this is like a souffle like consistency this-tastes like chocolate mousse raw so good-right into the other let's make this happen into like a medium saucepan adding in one and a quarter cups of packed light brown sugar I have a quarter teaspoon of-salt be a little generous if you want to add a bit more one and a half sticks of unsalted butter at room temperature why unsalted butter because different our makers have different amounts of salt in their salted butter so we want to control the salt can you go one can of evaporated milk and that is 12 fluid ounces or 354 milliliters right and then the last thing is three egg yolks so reserve those whites use them for-something later you can make a healthy egg white omelet which is disgusting to atone for your sins after eating all this cake - and three yolks there we go wash your hands I'm gonna mix this up a bit we use a French whisk for this-French whisks are narrower and not as bulbous as a regular balloon whisk-that's nice because it can get the corners of your pot and nothing's gonna-get burnt in there everything will be whipped up mix it up a little bit then put it on heat and don't forget that splash of vanilla it's 1 teaspoon that's a teaspoon right onto heat I have set this clumpy lumpy mixture over medium heat go ahead and just start stirring it that butter will melt up everything's gonna be okay and this isn't a smell so-amazing it's gonna be like a candy facial okay by the by you could have used melted butter in here and it would've been so easy why didn't I think of this I'm changing on the recipe card use melted butter there we go it's melting up just stir continuously in about five minutes you're gonna have a-very thick mixture coming to a boil-keep those pecans a rough chop they don't need to be fine you can have big-pieces it's all about that texture all right I think we're done something take it off the heat and add this other-ingredients in transfer this into a bowl so it cools down a bit faster this copper pot is very hot right now I'm gonna add my toasted pecans in there-what so fragrant and last but not least this sweetened shredded coconut it's angel flake cook and and my mom used to keep this in the freezer shirt my brother and I would sneak a handful every day in the afternoon we like take a little bit-until there was none left I'm home I'm making a German chocolate cake waiters all my coconut in our bellies all right now just mix it up to combine everything-and try not to snack too much it's still-pretty hot this stuff this stuff is the-business that is so good if you haven't-had German chocolate cake where have you been where have you been eat this make it eat it set this aside until it is cool enough to spread onto your cool cake layers that are still in the oven and you'll have a delicious-amazing treat this cake is so tender but there's a trade-off it's delicate and as that cake cools down all those air-bubbles will shrink a little bit as the air condenses less kinetic energy blah blah blah things you don't care about-and you know it's gonna collapse a little bit but it is still the most amazing cake it's not all chemicals-there's a lot of you know from the sodium bicarbonate there's a lot of those egg whites having it fluffed it up so a little shrinkage is okay don't worry about it I'm gonna gently invert it onto a wire cooling rack all these things I don't normally do okay and there you go and then this take the parchment off immediately because it's changing the rate at which the bottom-shrinks down but that's very nice look this cake this cake I tell you-[Music] lift it up get that parchment paper off-quickly because isn't it change the rate at which the bottom shrinks and you don't want your cake layers to be all you know trapezoidal with our-cross-section you a nice cylindrical prisms like these cool completely before you assemble trust me the weight will be worth it this cake is going to be so fun to assemble all I have to do is get an-ice-cream scooper and scoop on a thick layer of that insane frosting scoop it on or just like plop it on with the spoon if you don't have an ice cream scooper and then give it a quick smooth-don't be too careful about it though add on the next layer repeat the process and then add a final giant as thick as possible layer of the frosting on top you can give it a nice like a gentle smooth don't try and make it look too perfect because this is a rustic looking delicious cake so just smooth it out a little bit and then it's ready to eat-you can store this at room temperature if it's like cupboard under a cake dome overnight or refrigerate it bring it-back to room temperature and eat the-entire thing I am so ready for
