hey bakers today we're making a classic-French dessert which just so happens to be my all-time favorite chocolate eclairs light as air choux pastry filled with vanilla pastry cream and then dipped in chocolate so easy to make so satisfying let's get started choux is one of my all-time favorite-things to make it is so so simple it's-basically foolproof 1/2 a cup or 113 grams of unsalted butter 1 cup of water-240 milliliters half a teaspoon of salt-and like a teaspoon and a half two-teaspoons of sugar we're gonna put this-over high heat and bring it to a rolling-boil take this off of the heat really fast dump in 1 cup or 120 grams of flour and stir hard or the wooden spoon stir stir stir stir stir until it's all-incorporated and we're gonna stir for like 30 to 60 seconds there we go okay-now back onto the heat and stir for another 30 seconds or so you're gonna see this form like a ball now we're gonna dump this out into a stand mixer you can see it's super hot-so start mixing it on like medium and cracking an egg in at a time one egg mix-steam once it's incorporated at the next in we're gonna want to scrape the bowl down to love the color third egg I want you to see it's becoming kind of like more cohesive like it's pulling away and-forming strands we want the dough to be-hanging on to the paddle attachment but dripping down slowly so you want like a nice silky consistency this isn't here-yet so we're gonna add in one final egg not no add in one final eggs like a bit at a time and let's just see what this-is that almost there I'm gonna add the rest of that egg in that's a total of-four eggs okay take a look at this-clinging silky falling away slowly-that's exactly what we want now we can transfer this to a piping bag and I I have to tell you the color is just-amazing and what I eat this raw yes I've done that and I think it's delicious I'm transferring my dough to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip that's an-869 normally I would use a round tip but a star tip should give you a little bit more control when it's baking and have a nice puffy and prettier Eclair but both work and I don't mind the more rustic-look of a round tip if you don't have a piping tip just snip the tip off your pastry bag and it'll be fine I have a little dollop of dough here I'm gonna look you see there I'm a little dollop-of dough here and I'm just going to add a smear onto the corners of my baking-sheet it'll hold it in place while I pipe and do my egg wash I don't think-I'm moving around I'm gonna try and pipe these out nice and pretty but if things fall apart the egg wash fixes everything so don't freak out don't worry about it-make sure to space them out a few inches apart because they do get puffy in the oven something very satisfying about piping is out we're gonna fix those tips at the end don't worry you can also use a pair of scissors to cut the end off-that works too and it's not cheating setting aside we have another batch left these need an egg wash before they go into the oven it'll make them nice and brown a little gloss a tablespoon of milk one egg give it a quick mix here's a little tip-if things didn't go as wonderfully as you'd like during the piping and a little bit miss shapen you can use your egg wash to kind-of go things together it'll fix a lot of the issues you don't want any little points coming off at least because they're-definitely going to burn these bake at a high temperature so just use the egg wash to push down a little bit and then you can gently brush the rest of the way-this one's a little fat so I'm going to-push it together over here think of it-as baking Photoshop the ridges are really going to disappear for the most part but they help control the spread-during baking so that's why they're there that looks good one more batch to go these are going to go into the oven at 425 for 15 minutes then reduce the-temperature to 375 and bake for an-additional 20 25 minutes or so until they're nice and golden brown and don't be afraid to turn these around halfway through so that they get a nice even color first off the custard it has to chill so you got to make it first you could even make it the day before you're gonna add in 2 cups of whole milk and you have an option I'm gonna go the old-fashioned way and use an actual vanilla bean it's like what are you like dirty old string that's very expensive-no vanilla beans if you don't want to like buy these because they are pricey-get vanilla bean paste it has all the beans in it a lot of vanilla flavor-vanilla extract tastes almost exactly the same so you could also just use the extract the only thing you're gonna miss a little seeds all right we're gonna split this in half just cut down the-middle and now use your knife and scrape out all those seeds throw the pod in as well we're gonna bring this just to a boil and then take it off the heat we want nice hot vanilla milk for this custard right and then while that's happening while my milk is heating up let's get to the egg yolks so I need six egg yolks for this we're gonna separate the whites out and if you're careful about it the whites could be used for a meringue just pop them in the freezer for later that will just came to a boil-it's off the heat now let that milk infuse with all that vanilla one two three four five and okay six egg yolks add two thirds of a cup of sugar-right into that bowl and whisk until it's light and fluffy well what's can till it's lighter in color doesn't it be super fluffy this is where my exercise for the day will come see that's lighter in color thickened up wonderful 1/4 cup of cornstarch so I'm just going to sift as I whisk to avoid-lumps nice and incorporated I have my hot milk mixture I'm gonna get a quarter cup of it and use it to temper the egg-yolk so basically we're whisking in a small amount to warm the mixture up so that when we dump the rest in slowly and-carefully you don't get scrambled eggs-carefully I'm going to drizzle this in while I'm whisking vigorously vigorously-effect carefully now I have my hot-mixture what I'm gonna do is just clean this out really quickly and then we're-going to strain it back in set it over-heat and it's gonna be almost done you're gonna set it over and whisk whisk whisk whisk whisk continuously and by the by I'm using my French whisk which is a narrower shape than the traditional balloon whisk so much handier I feel for getting the corners of the pan it just-started thickening up the bubbles are going away and we're just gonna stir really vigorously and we're done okay so off the heat I want you to take a look that is what you're looking for it smells so good so thick and lovely so hot needs to go into the fridge but of course a custard will form a skin really-quickly just like a pudding so you want to cover it with plastic let it chill for a few hours overnight just get it cold so for the eclairs chocolate glaze-I'm gonna chop up maybe about five-ish ounces of a really-nice dark chocolate so I'm basically making a ganache if you have a favorite-way of making a gosh you can let me know in the comments I'm all ears I have half a cup of hot cream in here let's just-add the chocolate in you can see it's already starting to melt just leave it-alone for a bit let it hang out for a few minutes and then when you come back-you can whisk it up it'll be nice and silky and if it isn't a couple bursts and the microwave will fix everything-all right let's check this ganache it's been a few minutes mmm I love this part-it genuinely brings me joy so pretty look at this silky ganache that's perfect my pastry cream from yesterday that I made is all firmed up nice and cool and because I haven't had breakfast yet-there's my favorite thing to eat I said-okay so we're gonna make a little bit of whipped cream and a by a little bit I mean one full cup of heavy whipped cream and you go and then we're gonna whip it-up with mm couple tablespoons of sugar flip it up-[Music] getting thick I'm gonna add in a splash of vanilla very nice take a look perfect-okay choose however much you want to fold in you can fold in a tiny little bit a lot it's up to you now you're gonna whisk this in it'll make it more pipeable too-okay there we go now I have a pastry cream with a little bit of whipped cream folded in and it's gonna be easier to fill my eclairs and it isn't it so delicious I could just eat this entire-Bowl okay what am I gonna do to fill these the best way is to use a 230 piping tip this is basically like a really large injector needle and it's going to pierce the bottom like that-squeeze in that delicious pastry cream that we lightened with the whipped cream-and you're gonna be done if you don't-have one of these tips what you could do is this cut the Eclair in half fill it with the filling however you want and then make it into like a sandwich it's better not to overfill your piping bag because as your hands will warm this up and it'll become a little bit runny so cold is best this looks so daunting take a cool-declare shell and then just fill it up and you'll feel it getting heavy holds a lot I was like is any coming out Phil-Phil Phil and you can just fill either-until you see it coming at the top or it feels like it's heavy enough there we go this feels nice and substantial now these hold so much pastry cream one of the reasons I like lightening these up with whipped cream is because they're does like little balloons they hold a ton I would eat this right now in a hot second but for you I'm waiting for the chocolate these should be filled pretty-much right before serving for best results because you want the shell to have that kind of nice crispness about it the pastry cream will make things soggy after a while now for the finishing touch a dip in that silky chocolate ganache I cannot tell you how excited I am to eat this-that's very nice very nice doesn't that look like sexy I don't know-do you want me I do just like that perfect if chocolate looks a little bit off a little cream roll whisking fixes everything let's let's have a bite do you see all this pastry cream on the inside with the chocolate this really crisp-paper-thin ultralight shell mm-hmm I'm not going to subject you to me eating-but if you love this recipe check out my ultimate
