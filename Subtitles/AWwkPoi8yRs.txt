today I'm going to show you how to make this amazing orange cranberry pecan-bundt cake and the secret extra-virgin-Spanish olive oil so delicious and so much healthier than you'd ever think-possible for a cake this delicious okay let's get started first thing is to toast some pecans and toasted pecans by the way are one of my favorite things to snack on so instead of measuring out the approximate cup I'll be using I'm going to pour out most of the bag because-these are excellent excellent snacking material alright that's good just spread them out on the sheet and we're gonna pop it into the oven at 350 F or 177 C for about you know like eight minutes or so you want them to be nice and golden-brown like even more golden brown they are now and it'll be fragrant you'll be able to smell them but if you toast them too long they become bitter so keep an eye out pecans are out of the oven the pan is just cool enough to touch and I want to show you the difference between a toasted pecan and a non toasted pecan-I wish you could taste the difference but try the recipe you can get that done-so can you tell which one is toasted mmmh it's this one nice reddish so fragrant whenever you use nuts in a recipe you got to toast them first just just do it for me it makes a huge difference these will now get chopped-but this is actually way easier just-take a bun a handful crunch this is now an ASMR video so you want to have just-like you know different sized pieces I think this is so much easier than-chopping them if you get one that's not not crushed just crush individually this-I find it very relaxing so tactile okay after you've crushed all of your pecans we're gonna measure out about a cup but if you are a nut lover like me go ahead-and use like a cup and a half you go to town once you've crushed about a cup of pecans just you know double-check to make sure maybe you're a little bit under if you're a little bit over it-doesn't matter these guys are for snacking set them-slide now we're going to dump this into-a small bowl and just dredge it with a-little bit of flour take about a tablespoon maybe a little bit less just-sprinkle it around and now mix it up-this will help but not solve the problem-of heavy things settling in the batter-because the flour will basically trap some air around the pecans and the cranberries we do this as well and it'll-be settling a little bit more slowly-during the baking so it all won't fall to the bottom we're to the wise set that-aside and now we're going to do the same thing for the cranberries take about a cup if you hate cranberries you don't have to put them in skip it you could also do dried cherries whatever you'd like dredge them in flour again so just sprinkle little toss if you have some clumps of dried cherries just break them up you used to look pretty good set it aside and now it's time to work on our easy breezy batter-by-the-by keep that up and on at 350 but don't grease your bundt pan yet I had a total catastrophe I might like I'll put the video in like a little insert to show you but I was recipe testing for this and I didn't lubricate my pans sufficiently uh-uh they were glued in there it was horrible the cake tasted nice but it was like a hot mess totally not usable for photography now to the batter into my standing mixer fitted with a whisk attachment I'm adding in one and a half cups of sugar in you go-then we're gonna add in five whole eggs just dump them in look and now we're going to zest and orange I'm also going to add in just a little bit of lemon-zest because I like that punch that's-optional though and if you want to go-crazy add more orange zest in I am an orange zest fanatic whenever use s any citrus fruit the best thing to do is-have a nice sharp zester I get so many questions about like how do you make zesting look so easy it's just because there's-as sharp and I've said this before but-I'll tell you again-I've bought zester's fresh out of the packaging and they are dull as dirt it's so annoying this beautiful zest love the color and it's just packed with orange oil so it's so fragrant and of course I know you-know this but you always zest before you juice it's not impossible to zest half of an orange but it's so much more difficult and you run the risk of really cutting yourself so that's done just a little bit of lemon zest - I love lemon zest now we're gonna mix this up for like almost 10 minutes it's gonna go from being this just pile of eggs and sugar and zest into a like very thick fluffy concoction not thick and fluffy like meringue but like considerably thicker and fluffier so whisk start low-go to high and just it'll be running for almost 10 minutes time it while that's mixing up we're gonna juice our orange I probably need like two oranges for three-quarters of a cup strainer let's measure it out-three quarters of a cup and plus a-little bit extra for my glaze so this mixture is pretty light and fluffy-actually has a few more minutes to go but you see the difference this is like very thick full of tiny little air bubbles just how we want it but in the-meantime let's mix up our dry mixture-it's super easy three cups or three-hundred and sixty grams of all-purpose flour right into there our scale will totally be helping us do this 360 grams-one tablespoon of baking powder and you go and half a teaspoon of salt that's it sift it up and we'll whisk it up all-right now we're gonna finish up three more-minutes nine minutes later mixa mixa here's what's going to happen-some sour cream goes in here mix to combine-but first let's add our three-quarters of a cup of fresh orange juice back into that bowl and where is that like delicious wonderful texture like soft cake unison to come from it's coming-from a wonderful extra-virgin olive oil-this one comes from olive oils from-Spain I love the smell it's really just-like everything you want olive oil to be so let's drizzle that in there we want-one full cup of olive oil for this cake-this might be one of the healthiest cakes I've ever made because all that extra virgin olive oil is such a good fat for use not artery-clogging it's really like just the perfect balance-that's why I love cooking with olive oil but you can also bake with it too so this one is going to be a delightful delicious but healthy cake pour that in there-let's out that half a cup of sour cream-right in there if you don't have sour cream you can use plain yogurt or if you want to make this a non-dairy cake just-add in an extra half cup of the extra virgin olive oil from Spain get mixing now we're going to pour in our olive oil and orange juice mixture that was very fast very fast like no on slow we're gonna pour in our olive oil and orange juice mixture notice there's no splatters perfect okay we have our dry mixture so while this mixes on low we're just gonna add this in slowly I'm gonna use my hands to guide it and let me just tell you you need to put olive oil in everything super high in antioxidants rich in monounsaturated fats has anti-inflammatory purposes and it's delicious look at this we have a delicious very nice liquidy batter what you want to do is get all of that zest-off of the whisk because that's the best part-I love zest we're almost done with our batter and almost done with the cake it's so easy if you want you can add in a teaspoon of orange blossom water to really up the orange aunty here I will be doing that since I love oranges about a teaspoon we have 1 cup of chopped and-floured and toasted pecans not in that-order toss those in and one cup of not chopped but flowered and untoasted dried cranberries before I mix them up I'm gonna make sure to get this situation-all nice and slippery I'm using some baking spray so just really really hit it get that column too you don't want to have any bits that are not slippery need to be really slippery to come out of the pan you know what I'm gonna cheat just a-little bit on this cake and be so be tricky I'm reserving some of the batter-with almost none of the nuts you can do this beforehand before you pour-everything in there now I'm gonna put this in the pan and really get it into those crevices the nuts and the cranberries if they're falling at the bottom of the pan they might take up some space in the batter and you want this to have like a very beautiful edge so let's just drizzle that on to the very bottom now I'm going to know this really hard on the counter but I'm-gonna push there's some towel underneath it so I don't damage the counter it's very delicate soapstone if you want to be a little bit extra go ahead and just push down to really make sure that batter is coating and I'm pushing the batter out towards the crevices too now-just fold in those nuts that have been sitting there along with the cranberries-this batter smells just bonkers oh-ho my gosh I wish you could smell it it's so unexpected to have the really-beautiful like fragrant plate just so subtle the olive oil fragrance but it's combining with the orange in just an amazing way amazing I tell you okay-that's nice and folded you're gonna fill this up about maybe two-thirds of the way because there will be rising happening and that's actually fine okay and now I'll have enough batter left over for six mini buns or I think you guys should make two of these the big bundt pans are gargantuan and they bake forever so I like the next size down-give this one more tap that's gonna bake up for about 40 minutes if you're making the giant bundt 50 minutes to an hour-move it around like 180 degrees halfway through baking and then keep an eye on it towards the end because it's gonna go from being like perfectly done to perfectly done but really caramelized on-the outside and some people are very finicky some people like me are finicky about how burnt their cake looks I do like the way it tastes so especially on-the buns because there's a little bit of crunchiness on the outside the inside is-very soft and pillowy and the glaze we're gonna make for the outside has a little bit of crunch too especially when hardens well everything's baking I'm gonna make some-glaze now I'm assuming this isn't have a double glaze recipe because I made a lot of cakes but you know let's start off with one cup ish of confectioner sugar you could sift that if you want but it'll all work out in the end now I'm gonna drizzle in some orange juice very exact recipe you know-about some of but you're gonna be adding-more and less of each ingredient to get the right consistency and this isn't it-look like a mess to begin with like is this gonna form a glop and then it'll-all tighten up in the end if you want-your glaze to be a beautiful color try-adding in some raspberry juice or blood oranges for a nice soft millennial pink-I'm fine with like a nice kind of paper-off-white color for the orange so this is actually like a pretty nice drizzling consistency but I think I want a thicker drip so just add more confectioner sugar-there we go the confectioner sugar is like basically all air so once you introduce a liquid it's like compresses-to nothing so here's the gloppy mess I was talking about but this will all get worked out you have to give it basically-a second just for that all that like confectioner sugar to absorb the liquid-from the orange juice and then it will it'll loosen back up again but if it doesn't you can add in some more juice-and I think I'm actually gonna add just a bit of lemon juice here I really like my glaze to have like an acid kick because it's all sugar so you want to have a contrast so a little bit of mixing later we have a nice glaze and this is the dripping consistency I like you can see it's gonna form like a nice ribbon just for a moment before it oozes back into itself that's gonna be perfect-for that kind of like sexy glaze that we want to have at the end of it oh love it-I'm gonna warn you though this will dry out really quickly so I'm gonna cover it-in plastic wrap and just understand that-I'll be adding in some more lemon juice before I'm ready to pour because even covered it will dry out and thicken up my little mini buns are out of the oven-and I'm just gonna trim the very top most fluffy parts but just on the inside that's for snacking later I just want to have the doming a little bit under control but this is actually optional-all right cooling rack and we'll flip them over carefully because pan is super hot these are a nice golden color lots of cranberries are visible and I'm gonna let them cool down before I glaze them-so don't eat them right away even though they're really delicious new just pull them apart and dip them in that glaze-don't do that this cake just came out of the oven a minute ago and normally you might want to have a bundt cake rest for like five minutes in the pan just because it's so tender right out of the oven but I'm feeling very impatient today and cocky-so let's see how this goes flip it under and do you think it's gonna be okay-should I check it out huh look at that-this is gorgeous-beautiful I love it really aromatic I'm gonna let this cool down since it's steaming up but right after it's cool I can drizzle over some beautiful orange and lemon glaze and then get to eating-pouring all of this really zingy glaze over my cake you can just douse it in-the glaze or be sparing if you want it's-really delicious just right out of the-oven but the glaze is such a nice little finishing top and I love it if you mix-up a really thin glaze and all just soak into the cake and kind of disappear if you do a really thick glaze it you'll-have that like nice white strip I actually did two glazings because my-first one looked beautiful on camera as you can see but then it all soak in so I did a thicker one to have that nice white contrast for all my photos I'll be taking I've been dying to have this piece of cake except that's a lie because I've been snacking my little heart out on these mini buns I made remember those I didn't forget about them there delicious - and so small look at this let me let me break this up for you what what cranberries pecans like is there magic inside of this why-does it taste so good okay here's the deal that olive oil that extra virgin-Spanish olive oil so good all that zest in there totally a good-yep every glaze you make should have orange and/or lemon juice in it thanks-so much for watching I hope you liked the video if you have any questions leave them in the comments below hit that subscribe button and press like
