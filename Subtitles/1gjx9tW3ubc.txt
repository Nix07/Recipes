today I'm going to show you how to make a favorite treat of mine these are-Mexican wedding cookies but hold everything because depending on where you're from they could be called any number of things I'm part Greek so in my-family we could also call them gonna be-Ennis these can be made in so many different permutations I have mine with almond flour and a little bit of vanilla but some people use rosewater some people use pistachios walnuts and they're all delicious this is a really easy recipe that comes together in a snap so let's get started I'm adding one-cup or 226 grams of unsalted room-temperature butter into my standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment-boom we're basically making butter cream to start off with but it turns into a cookie magically cream it up butter is-nice and creamy we're gonna add in-three-quarters of a cup of confectioner's sugar now it's just add that in there in stages or all at once and then mix on low once is going add in a quarter teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of vanilla extract-okay that's good now for the dry ingredients I have 3/4 of a cup of almond meal here and I am gonna be sifting this almond flour or almond meal is notoriously being a lumpy so let's just give it a sift sift sift sift sift-I am this in the habit of doing this for making macarons or meka at all and you know you wanna sift all of your-ingredients over and over again this-cookie is much more forgiving so if you're short on time skip it just toss it in it's not a big deal but there are like these giant almond pieces which you know it could be a plus or a minus if you like creamy or chunky add it in why not take a second and scrape the-bowl down let's just get a nice crepe-now for our final ingredient two and a-half cups of all-purpose flour this is the magic that'll turn this kind-of like delicious goo into a cookie batter so just slowly add this in while this is mix it on low this is a cascade of flour scrape it down final mix okay that's it this looks maybe a bit rough but it shapes into a dough really easily and okay this is the fun part we're gonna start shaping these up now my mom is from Mexico my dad was Greek and in Mexico these are called Mexican wedding cookies but in-Greece they're called gonna be ettus and that's a horrible pronunciation all my fellow Greeks out there I'm so sorry it's been many years-since my last free language class but anyways they're really popular cookies in Greece around Christmas time and the fun thing is that like every single-culture has their version of these cookies some of them add rosewater some of them add pistachios it is every-single kind of permutation for this cookie exists in the world and it's-amazing all right we're gonna shake these out put them on to our baking-sheet and get those in the oven and we're gonna be basically done in my-family we have three shapes for these-cookies we have bars we have little balls and then we have these like little horseshoe crescent-shaped things and I-don't know if that's like how it's supposed to be but it's how it happens-in the canal household now it's my way-or the highway okay-have a ball and then the crescent shape it up and this isn'ta get like-completely drenched in powdered sugar so-don't worry it was like a little crack or it doesn't look perfect no one's gonna notice so a cyclin is recipe of being like basically global and like having all these different variations which I love I love that it's a family tradition in my house because like when-I'm making these right now it reminds me-of like my mom and being little with her in the kitchen and how she would help me and show me how to do things and it literally makes me want to pick up the phone and give her a call-and like my kids are outside right now I was like hey kids so I can't wait for them to be old enough to do this with me-and have those memories too if you want your cookies to look more perfect you're gonna give them like a better roll roll them on the counter or roll them in your hands a little bit more and they'll be less hand shaped in case you want things-to be perfect looking but you got to press them together a bit too so you-have like press press press and then roll roll roll yep and you get like a nice little ball my first batch of cookies is ready to go into the oven 375 for 10 to 12 minutes these are gonna be good okay into the oven while these are piping hot out of the oven I'm tossing-them in powdered sugar carefully you-don't to break the cookies but they do have to get kind of pressed in a bit and the cookies themselves are not that sweet so this powdered sugar on the outside really makes a magic happen everybody who knows these cookies will agree with me trust me the only thing is you have to be careful not to breathe in-when you take a bite because you will get like the choking powdered sugar in-your throat situation it's kind of like as they're steaming out a bit you get that stickiness for the powdered sugar to hold on to so at my house we also make versions of those with ground walnuts and that is pretty darn good too-so if you don't like almonds just grind up some walnuts or give them a really really really fine chop and then substitute that in and you will be in heaven okay round two that's my burnt one I like Britain cookies okay hot very very hot I like to bury-mine in powdered sugar just tamp it down a bit roll it around and then you know it's ready the only thing you have to do at the very end of this is give it a very light dusting of powdered sugar because more sugar okay just dust there so pretty like little snowy treats-well ah all done so excited to try this out see how it compares to all my memories is the hype real it is real this is so good it really is like a crunch mount crunch smell it just dissolves in your mouth and it is so good oh my gosh the almond and the weird-thing is it's not that sweet even though it's like completely covered in confectioner sugar it is not a-super-sweet cookie you got to trust me-on this perfect for a little coffee or tea in the morning and the S you'll be-snacking on them all through the day so be prepared to make an extra batch-alright thanks so much for watching I hope you get a chance to make this-recipe give any questions leave them in-the comments below and don't forget hit that like
