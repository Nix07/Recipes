hey bakers today I'm going to show you-how to make the perfect vanilla cake so much vanilla so much butter so much deliciousness let's get started starting off with 213 grams or about 1 and 2/3 cups of all-purpose flour you could also use cake flour if you wanted to now so close to perfect 230 there we go a little bit less than a teaspoon of-salt it's kind of up to you quarter teaspoon of baking soda and one teaspoon of baking powder 1 cup of white granulated sugar that's 200 grams sift it whisk it up we're gonna set it aside and work on the very wet ingredients-into a bowl I'm adding 3/4 of a cup or-170 hundred 76 grams of butter not melted not solid you could use-room-temperature butter you could use melted butter I've come to enjoy this texture 1/2 a cup of whole milk 1/2 a cup of sour cream 3 egg whites this-recipe uses egg whites because I like my vanilla cakes to be a little paler the yolks make it a beautiful yellow cake-I'll often color these and make the cake like pink or you know even light blue sometimes so a lighter cake will also hold its color better if you want to use the whole egg totally fine just remove a quarter cup of the sour cream I'll clean that up later three egg yolks later-this can be set aside and make a-delicious lemon curd a raspberry curd so many wonderful things 1 tablespoon 15 milliliters of vanilla extract now I'm gonna whisk this up if you see little clumps of butter hanging around don't worry about it one little bit it'll all even out when you add it to the dry and bake it it'll be fine but right now let's just give it a whisk that's whisked up we're gonna pour the wet into the dry and just mix to combine-plus little extra all right now let's whisk gently not Nestle you could also use a paddle attachment in a stand mixer-or you could use an electric mixer with little hand beaters if you want so I just gave it a whisk like 30 seconds you can see now it's a nice smooth cohesive batter and this is the right consistency-you could use a baking spray if you want-I've been doing that lately because I am often cutting it really close on time-but my preferred way to prep a pan is by just rubbing some cold butter it's cold you use less onto the pan and then-flowering it so lose that butter around take a tablespoon of flour and then just kick it around get the sides and then tap it on to the next pan perfect I just repeat the process a little blessing of extra flour that cake mix now I'm going to use a scale to get the exact same-amount of cake into each pan I like to-have really even layers but if you can't or don't have access to a scale just like use a toothpick like an oil gauge kind of and you can see how much batter is in each pan so 280 this recipe does not make any extra batter so even though it tastes delicious right now don't eat it I'm using some cake strips these are really beat-up and ratty and make a lot-of cakes but they're just wet fabric-strips these are from Wilton there are many brands you can make your own out of fabric you can make them out of tin foil and paper towels you can click up here to see how they work and how to make your own they give you perfect flat cake layers that are really nice and tender-on the sides there's no trimming needed and they come out just perfect for stacking I love using them I highly encourage you to start as well if you do cake decorating and multi-layer cakes-these are going to go into the oven at-350 for about half an hour you will see the center gets springy you touch it and the edge will pull away from the pan that's how you know when they're done if you under bake your cakes the bottom might not release and things will get a little sad so just make sure they're perfectly done keep an eye on them while this cake layers were baking up I'm gonna whip up a quick and easy batch of American vanilla buttercream such a classic so easy so sweet but a whole other group of people think that it's too sweet so for them we could make a Swiss meringue buttercream also very easy it takes a-couple more minutes so I'm not gonna lie-but it gives you the creamiest silkiest-frost and you can imagine not too sweet-very versatile and it is perfect for piping you could do anything with it it's kind of amazing but back to our-American buttercream this is gonna be so much faster than that here I have three sticks which is hmm why don't have cups of unsalted butter at room temperature-and I'm going to gracefully gracefully drop it in there the gold medal for John-creamed it up just for a few seconds-okay and now we're gonna add in some confectioner sugar normally and I would-sift all of this up this is a brand new-bag it's probably fine but if I was piping buttercream roses or something with a fine piping tip I don't want anything to clog it up today I'm not doing any event so if you get a nice and-quick beautiful easy cake so just dump the sugar in in several batches and then-mix on low you might want to cover it with a tea towel if needed I'm gonna add my vanilla and now a little bit of-moisture helps get things started okay-it's getting smooth I'm gonna add in a little bit more sugar a little bit more sugar into the bowl-that's more than a half a pound leftover just keep mixing no back to the tea towel there you go my mixer it needed a babushka final batch of sugar in there just a little bit of a modesty towel-I'm adding in a very healthy teaspoon of salt right now-I meant pinch but it's about a teaspoon-oh I wanted to show you that as you whip the buttercream up it becomes fluffier and lighter in color now it's much paler and it's good I'm going to add a little bit more vanilla in though two shots of-vodka later and there we go so this is done I am gonna-add in just a drop of soft pink food coloring because I feel like the cake would look like a sad wedding cake if it was just like a white cake with white frosting on top we're gonna make it pop a little bit with some pink one drop there we go let's see that's nice I'm gonna add another drop in okay two drops of coloring in scrape the bowl down even though I'm using a scraping paddle attachment gonna gracefully add in one tablespoon of cream just to thin it out a tiny bit-good that's nice k cleaners are just out-of the oven the nice thing about those cake strips in addition to the flat layers is it lets you handle the cake-quickly because the pans real hot dump-it out very nice a little bit a little-bit darker than I would have wanted that's totally fine very soft is how pillowy that is mmm and it smells delicious you can see the cake has pulled away from the pan and if you're ever wondering like oh how do I know if-it's ready or not you can shake it-around a little bit and if it kind of shakes around the pan it's ready to come out if it's stuck it might need another-minute perfect all right this is the one that needed another minute let's see if it worked yeah chest chest baked it's like a-Goldilocks situation Joe John luckily I had a swap-out ready since I didn't want to waste time so there's one right here all cooled and done it's never happened before my poor cake it can be cake pops or secret eating cake I don't know-anyway so that's just carefully look so nicely flatly baked I'm gonna set these aside once your cake layers are nice and cool it's time to add on your buttercream I like to pipe it on just-because it's a fast and neat for me and it doesn't tug at the cake a lot of times with a really tender cake if you're tugging at it trying to spread buttercream it will break or tear the-cake layers which is not where do you want to be this is much easier and it's kinder to your cake layers and you can see how fast it is too it's like Oh in an instant you're done ex-player on now we're going to add the outer butter cream on I'll have like a nice kind of thick layer on top check the sides out make sure everything is nicely aligned-nothing's leaning and you have a couple-options you could either do a naked cake-kind of like this semi naked which I like where you just have a very thin layer of frosting on the outside or you could completely encase it so we'll see how I feel-alright I'm using a bench scraper to scrape the side of the cake clean off-the excess every couple of turns and I'm-going to go for semi-naked and see how I like it okay now for the top so use an offset spatula if you have one and just smooth it out back to the bench scraper once you're-set my satisfied at the top just like a lot of excess to remove now take your offset spatula and pull in while you turn to clean the edge of the cake stand-I'm just gonna use a paper towel and-[Music]-remove as much as I can in a couple swipes fold it over and then just do the-same thing you can switch to a damp paper towel and that'll get rid of the rest once you're satisfied you can just give it one final swipe to clean up anything on the bottom that happened-that's pretty good now we have a nice basic cake ready for a couple more decorations maybe some spires or dollops maybe like a little seashell pattern you-can have some confetti sprinkles and see what we want to do I thought about my plain little cake for a few minutes went to the market got some flowers and here's doesn't happen doesn't arrange some roses on top like a little crown I thought about my cake and these little flowers and I actually don't like all of the green parts here I think it's-distracting so I'm just going to clean the flowers off so it's just petals and-I think that'll look nice or more-two-tone I didn't want to bring a third strong color in like that just by the by-you could do whatever you'd like there we go just a little bit of gardening later your pretty pink vanilla cake is ready I'm gonna cut this and photograph it and I'll be right back I don't know-about you but I'm ready for a taste-let's see how this turned out my first time eating my my own vanilla cake recipe little dainty bite oh my god I mean it is just like so-delicate tender hmm if you over bake the cake or any cake is gonna be hard and crusty and dry out so really using those cake strips makes a big difference I can't
