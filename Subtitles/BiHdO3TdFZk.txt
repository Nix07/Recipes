today I'm going to show you how to make thumbprint cookies super-easy my version-is a nice sugar cookie you press your thumb then add some jam whichever you like a little bit of glaze and that's it they are super fast fun to do with the kids and cute and delicious okay let's get started I'm adding four cups or 480 grams of all-purpose flour into my ball with a sifter attached it's gonna be-really fast and easy so watch carefully-there we go half a cup of cornstarch-this is that magic ingredient that lets those sugar cookies hold their shape so-they don't spread out and about a little-bit less than a teaspoon of kosher salt-okay sift it all together give it a whisk so everything's nice and combined-then set aside and it's time to cream-that butter and sugar into a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment-I'm adding in one full cup or 226 grams of unsalted butter at room temperature-and you go all of it and and you go very room-temperature-create up-it looks at Michoud right now one cup let it get nice and fluffy and then it's time for the eggs-[Music]-all right we can scrape the bowl down now love this color it's just off-white now while the mixers running add in those two eggs first one let it incorporate the second one next step-[Applause]-[Music] thank you-[Music] you can see it's nice and incorporated-scrape the bowl down just a bit and now we can add in our flour and cornstarch-stump that in there don't spill any or make a mess on very low mix it up okay well this is coming together let's add in a tablespoon of vanilla-I'm excited look at this this is what it should look like it's come together and you can see it's really like a nice-almost playdough eat consistency perfect for rolling out in fact you could roll this out right now pop it into the oven directly but it's a little bit soft to pick up the shapes so what we want to do is put this in a-plastic bag pop it into the fridge let-it chill for like 20 minutes or so so-it's hard enough for us to manipulate-with our hands without distorting the shapes because the shapes would want to be really really nice and perfect once your dough is all finished-just pinch off a little bit roll it around to create you know something approaching a ball pop it onto your-baking sheet and then press in with your thumb that's it old-fashioned cookie-it's super easy each one gets a little bit of jam and on to the next so for each cookie I'm pinching off like about like a tablespoon plus a little bit-extra of dough roll it around in your-hand and then press down that's it it's gonna crack a bit don't worry about it this is a really rustic cookie it's not like a perfect sugar cookie that's like you know gonna be on a magazine-with a beautiful icing it's just gonna taste good and look cute all right-there's my next one plop it in there and press down nice clean hands to do this work because it's a lot of hand stuff so you're going to keep rolling and you can use whatever you want to fill them up I have a combination of some blueberry jam for some strawberry jam-and even some apricot jam at the classics if you want to modify the dough there are so many things you can do you can add in toasted coconut you could add in orange zest lemon zest rosewater-pistachios so many things they will change the consistency but it's okay-because this is not a perfect cut out cookie is a thumbprint cookie so keep on rolling keep on pressing and then I'm-just gonna fill them all up at the same-time it's the easiest thing to do starting off by adding in my blueberry jam so every cookie will get its own special filling while the cookies are in the oven I'm gonna make a really simple glaze with just some confectioner sugar and a drop or two of milk if you like-something lemony you can add in some lemon juice instead of the milk this eyeball it is really about the consistency you just want to melt the sugar so a little bit of sugar a little bit of milk a few drops in there whisk it up and it's gonna be like not coming together not coming together until it-becomes a magical glaze at the very end-I might have added too much milk in it just FYI it's a little thin so I will be adding some more sugar in it look at that ball is going to come together I'm using my silicone whisk because the kids are napping right now and I don't want-to wake them it's precious moments I tell you okay that's nice nice drippy consistency I'm just a rake it across the cookies once they're out of the oven and cooled and it'll be a little bit-extra and dry nice cookies are out of-the oven and they're cool enough to handle so I'm gonna put them down and then it's time for that glaze here's what's gonna happen push them all together this this is-batch one of many but all right I'm-excited now it's time for that casual rake of sugar there we go look some of these cookies are getting a lot it's okay if you want to be really crazy like I often am you can use a piping bag with a very tip snipped off-and get a very controlled drip that way-this is my kids are napping drip gotta get it done all done look how cute that is this will set that sugar will get nice and crunchy and give you like a nice little bit of extra texture when you take a bite so excited so-old-fashioned gotta just wait until they set I'll be right back moment of truth I'm so excited this is-one of those really easy breezy recipes that's no stress and fun with the kids-guess make sure you wash their little hands before they press their thumbs and-I know it's an issue believe me okay-let's take a bite really crunchy on the outside nice and gooey on the inside-that little extra glaze was nice too and-I ate the blueberry one because that's my favorite alright thank you so much for watching hit that like
