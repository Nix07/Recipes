today we're gonna be making these dreamy-decadent that's super easy peanut butter-chocolate chip cookies they have the-perfect amount of everything they're basically foolproof and I don't-know if you can see but there's the sparkle of giant flakes of sea salt on-top and it is making all of your cookie dreams come true you've gotta believe me-on this okay let's get started first off we're gonna sift the dry ingredients starting with-two and a quarter cups or about 270 grams of all-purpose flour there we go-that's close three-quarters of a teaspoon of baking soda I'm adding in half a teaspoon of salt now but we're gonna garnish this cookie with beautiful flakes of sea salt at the end so you-will get a nice salty finish sift it up and give it a quick whisk okay now we can set that aside and get on to the butter and peanut butter and all that gooey goodness into the bowl of my stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment-I'm adding in one cup which is two sticks or about 230 grams of unsalted room-temperature butter and you go cream it up for like a few seconds now we're gonna add in a cup and a half of smooth peanut butter and I will give you some advice use the regular like supermarket brand it has a lot of emulsifiers and other ingredients in there that'll make it a bit more stable this is gonna be a little soupy but it'll all work out so don't worry and by my measurements a cup and a half of peanut butter is about 260 grams okay mix I would eat this just like that like with a spoon that is some delicious business okay so thanks to my glass bowl you can see there's a little-bit of butter on the very bottom just-scrape it down this recipe uses 3/4 of a cup of light brown sugar so just tap it-down you're actually packing it a little bit lightly packed brown sugar and then-2/3 of a cup of granulated sugar so in you go you might notice the white sugar will make the cookies spread out more and the brown sugar will make it a bit-kick here no cake here no one saw that-mix it it'll get a little bit lighter-and fluffier the peanut butter is weighing it down though if you make peanut butter cookies you know this already but adding more peanut butter will increase the peanut butter flavor and also make them like just super crispy like they're gonna dissolve in your mouth less peanut butter clearly less the flavor but the cookies will be-a bit stronger too less crumbly okay let's take a look a little bit lighter-in color little creamier now we're gonna add in two teaspoons of vanilla extract-one large egg to start mix it up and-then we'll add in the second large egg-gonna scrape the bowl down really-quickly and then we can add our dry ingredients in and this cookies almost-ready to eat now add your dry ingredients in you can do it you do all at once-mix on low until you're confident bad things won't happen okay look at that-now it's a dough but what could make this even better how about some chocolate chips I'm adding a cup and a half of semi-sweet chocolate chips in if you want to use milk chocolate that's on you I will have the dark I'm gonna mix this for like a few seconds and then fold it in by hand-[Music]-okay huh my this smells so good in fact-let's take a little test so kinda yeah-okay this will be delicious and I'll be right back with a swap out that I made-yesterday all right back with my chilled out and-I'm using a regular sized ice cream scoop I'll measure it out in a second in grams in case you're a Virgo like me and you like things to be exact just scoop-out the chilled dough pop it out and then we have about 50 grams look at this where are my chocolate chips they're all hiding inside but don't worry we're gonna fix it and make it look really cute just continue you want to space them out they will be spreading so I like to do kind of rows of two or three so these cookies are a mixed bunch just some of them are covered in chocolate some of them have almost none I want them to be uniform and look really pretty so pop in a couple of chocolate chips to the top maybe like three to four and just in-different orientations you can press a few in the main thing is that you're-gonna have some of the chocolate that's fully exposed and not comfort than you batter so to look nice and glossy once they bake and no one ever said too much chocolate right these cookies are looking away better but for my final blogger trick I'm gonna use some Maldon sea salt I'm not getting paid for this at all so don't worry it's not sponsored but this salt is bananas it has huge crystals in it which look beautiful on all sorts of dishes look at that salt crystal it's like a giant roof shingle that's in this back and this science teacher in me loves seeing the crystalline structure it's a it's a it's-a pyramid that's what it is it's that regular old square pyramid okay anyways now we're going to gracefully add on just a sprinkle on top the salt will not melt-so you'll have some beautiful flakes and the other thing I like about this is-it's paper-thin so even though the salt-crystals are huge you're not biting into a giant chunk of salt it really is a-perfect complement for this recipe all-right this is gonna go into the oven at-350 about 177 Celsius for maybe 13 to 15 minutes because you want them to start setting but not be fully baked they're-gonna spread out and they'll dome a bit but once you take them out of the oven they'll flatten and be a beautiful-cookie with a velvety finish-it'll be magic let's make this happen-but wait there's more I told you that if you use more peanut butter you get more flavor but it is more it doesn't have the structure so it's a trade-off these are delicious but they will start falling apart especially if you just hit-them with a heat gun right before this-right before this shot because you wanted the chocolate to look extra-glossy in the close-up if you liked this video check out my number to buy a hair-will use to be number one favorite
