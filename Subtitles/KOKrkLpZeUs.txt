today we're making a chocolate cake that is one gigantic two fairly pretty I think but three has a dark dark secret-it's filled with zucchini so if you have a child or significant other at home who's like I've never eat and vegetables-I hate them you can feed them this and don't be none of the wiser but you can slightly think you have had vegetables-fool really pretty so fast and easy let's get started I'm adding three cups of all-purpose flour into a large bowl that is under a sifter and over a scale this is three hundred and sixty grams in case you're measuring there we go this cake has a lot of zucchini in it but I don't want to taste the zucchini it's not as a Keaney bread it's really for the moisture so I'm using a full cup-of cocoa powder it'll be very dark very rich and very chocolatey one tablespoon-of baking soda three-quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder 3/4 of a teaspoon of salt and one and a half teaspoons of optional espresso powder but this makes a big difference really ups the chocolate ante and I think you're gonna love it-all right let's sift it and then whisk it very chocolaty a lot of lumps look at-this nobody wants this that's the sifters for cocoa powder is great when you mix it-with a lot of other ingredients but when you bite into a giant chunk of it it's not so charming give it a quick whisk and we can set it aside now it's time for those wet ingredients but first before we do the wet ingredients we need-to prep those zucchinis so I need about-four and a half cups that should be three medium zucchini maybe half more let's find out cut the tops off trim those bottoms and now we're to submit-grate it you can use a regular cheese grater no need to go extra fancy and fine it'll melt together in the oven-just watch your fingers I swear I've cut myself so much more often on a grater than with a sharp knife if you're trying to sneak these zucchini into your cake-you might want to peel them otherwise just leave the peel on it does make a-big difference but if someone doesn't-want to eat any veggies at all and they see little bits of green in the cake the game will be up ok does not look like much now but that's a lot of zucchini-ok well measure it out to make sure we don't need any more if you're a little bit short it's totally fine don't worry-about it-ok that is one cup two cups three cups-and change one more zucchini on the way-four and a half cups of freshly grated zucchini let's wipe this work surface off and then get to the wet ingredients-into the bowl of my standing mixer I'm adding in one and a half cups of vegetable oil mmm vegetable oil 1/2 a cup of sour cream one and a half cups of granulated sugar one packed cup so that's packing it down in of light brown sugar-plop meting in a tablespoon of vanilla as measured by my eyes and six whole eggs at room temperature this is ready-to mix up until it is a completely homogeneous and interestingly colored mixture I'm adding my scraping paddle attachment any paddle attachment will do though start on low increase speed carefully and let it run for a minute or two you just walk away come right back-check your email whatever you'd like ok my mixture is nice and homogeneous time to add in all that fresh zucchini mmm you won't taste the zucchini in this cake I promise you that most you'll get the most faintest botanical hint no one will know except for seeing a little of green flecks in your cake ok let's dump that all in so you can use full of water mix it up on slow now it's time to add in our dry mixture-I'm just gonna dump it all in you could add it in slowly if you prefer for some reason but dumping works as well carefully dump it I don't want to spill-this on my counter so let's mix on low I-will be covering this with a tea towel I actually do have those little plastic attachments here that are supposed to stop the things from spraying up at you-but they've never worked in my opinion-if they work for you use one of those Qi towel doesn't do hundred-percent neither now it's time to add in a one and a half-cups of chocolate chips optional you don't have to but I wanted to anyways so one and a half cups stir them in that's good so we're going to finish this off by hand there might be a couple stray little pockets of flour hanging at the-bottom mmm its batter look at this beautiful dark chocolate batter it's like a brownie almost so this is actually a big triple layer 8-inch cake-if you've watched my videos you know I usually make little tiny 6-inch cakes-they're perfect for a small family or someone who lacks portion control like-because they're big layers I'm using parchment rounds I just cut out out of-parchment paper to go on the bottom right here I just buttered the pans really quickly this will make your cakes-release in a snap you could either flour your pans leave them just like this or add a tiny bit of cocoa powder just kicking around the sides and it'll-really help the cake release now I'm ready to measure out three equal sized-layers get that batter in there I want to say it's like 600 grams each ish-maybe a bit less like 590 or 580 oh no-definitely more than 600 this a lot of batter that's a little bit less than 800 grams of batter in each pan that's a lot of batter but this is a lot of cake pop on some cake strips if you use them you-know all about it if you don't these are the magic little wet fabric bands that give you perfectly flat cake layers click up here to find-out how to use them how to make your own and how they work it's a fun video to-watch and it actually passed 1 million-views my highest video ever very-surprising to be honest right bought the last cake strip on and then these are ready to go into the oven at 350 for Oh probably about 40 minutes cuz this is a big cake for the chocolate shards on top-I'm melting about half a cup of dark chocolate the first step is to give it a nice chocolate-[Music] ideally I want these shards to temper so the chocolate will melt and then recrystallize in a way that it has a nice shine and a good snap but if that-doesn't happen because it can be a-little finicky especially if you're at-home without the thermometers and everything I have a cheek for you so let's see how this goes I'm gonna transfer this to a bowl and start microwaving it the best way is to use-the double boiler blah-blah-blah simmering water but I just don't feel-like it right now so I'm gonna do it the bad way which is to give it short really-low power bursts in your microwave it'll melt slowly but first let's reserve I-don't know maybe about a quarter or a third of this this is our special chocolate we will melt back in later-you'll see what happens so I've given-this about 330 second bursts at half power so I'm going to melt the chocolate-until it's just melted and then stir in this finely chopped or like you know-chopped cool chocolate with the correct crystal structure and then it should be magically tempered if it's too cold and it's not gonna melt you can go ahead and-either use a heat gun or your microwave-again and like a really short burst of-low power but just try and be patient you'll see that chocolate will melt this takes a minute you have to keep stirring it then we're gonna dump it out onto-some parchment paper and make some magic-happen for that tempered chocolate onto-a piece of parchment paper and spread it out with an offset spatula get some nice interesting edges because those are the-parts we're gonna be looking at while the chocolates set it only will take a few minutes on a cool countertop but if your chocolate isn't tempered don't worry you can still save it by sprinkling some cocoa powder on top it-gives it some more visual interest and no one will see the chocolates dull and not shiny once your chocolates set snapping pieces randomly you can have big ones small ones any kind of shard you want and then just set them aside-forth about our cream I told you this is a big cake so I don't hear any guff I'm using a pound and a half of butter there you go there you go let's clean this up for just a minute okay it screamed up so-I'm gonna add a teaspoon of salt in mmm-a third of a cup of cocoa powder you-could sift that if you want but living dangerously today let's give us a mix-all right that looks good let's scrape the bowl down look at that beautiful-color okay there's a little bit more of a whip it's really cold all right now-I'm going to be adding in between a pound and a half and two pounds of confectioner sugar bit by bit I'm also not going to be-sifting this because there's no piping tip happening today do a couple batches until it's all mixed in and you're satisfied with the-sweetness no nope nope nope we are gonna use a tea towel but mixed up some very strong espresso over here a little bit for me a little bit for you so add in about a teaspoon or so scrape that bowl down a little bit more-sugar don't get caught up on the ingredients you're adding in because you're not eating at all I hope unless-it's your birthday and you can do whatever you like right looking pretty good I'm gonna add in a splash of cream a little more espresso let's give it a taste-mm-hmm that's really good now it's time to make that chocolate ganache so let's heat up some cream in the microwave to make the chocolate ganache I have 3/4 of a cup of dark chocolate mini chips although anything is fine and 1/3 of a cup of hot scalded cream or on top swirl it around of it and let it sit there for-a minute just walk away let it do its thing and when we come back it'll be-nice and ready it's been a minute so let's give it a whisk and see how it is-it might not be warm enough maybe it-needs a little little toys app in the microwave but maybe it's ready to look crazy for a second but then it'll all come together and be this silky dreamy chocolate ganache this looks really liquidy now but probably just right consistency but I think that when we use it this will be just right look at that beautiful okay time to-assemble to decorate that cake I'm piping on a thick layer of that-delicious chocolate frosting onto the-first layer at the second layer on and repeat cover the cake completely in buttercream and now it's kind of up to-you you can either have a thick wonderful layer on the outside or you can scrape it away for a semi naked cake like I am smooth the side of the cake using a bench scraper and then the top with an offset spatula it doesn't have-to be perfect most of this is going to be covered up anyways so feel free to make some mistakes for that decadent ganache on top smooth it out and then add a few more strategic drips if you want to have that nice and drippy cake look like I did final step is to add those beautiful chocolate shards on top of the cake just-press them in create a pattern I really loved the way that nice dusting of cocoa powder added some visual contrast to the cake that was such a fun cake to decorate and my favorite part-the chocolate shards is tempered so nicely can you hear that perfect chocolate temper okay now for Hawaii-wow that's really good the cake is just-right so chocolatey not too sweet so-moist it's so much you wouldn't believe-it you can't taste the zucchini but you understand it's this thing different-about it it's really really nice it's like the mouthfeel is so great I hope you get to make
