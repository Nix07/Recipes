today I'm going to show you how to make this delightful chocolate mousse pie it-is beyond the beyond so silky creamy indulgent and just plain old decadent and yes there is a mound of whipped-cream with more chocolate shavings on top and a crispy crunchy beautiful handmade pastry dough shell let's get-started this pie crust is super easy and-you will fall in love with it it's and they become a favorite I promise two and a half cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour into the bowl of your food processor 300 grams there we go people ask me all the time what if I-don't have a food processor here's the deal you get the dry ingredients whisk them together and then the butter is frozen freeze your butter and create it with a cheese grater into dry mixture-add in like mix it up add in the ice water mix it by hand or you can use a knife if you want and it'll come together it's really easy and you get delicious giant chunks of butter in it it bakes perfectly so that's the deal if you don't have a food processor I only got mine this year so FYI okay half a-teaspoon of salt and four tablespoons of sugar you can change the amount of sugar if you want use a little bit less do and then there just a sprinkling I'm using less today move it around and now let's put on the processor and give it a whizz whizz it up just to mix it up now it's time for the butter cubed butter out of the fridge cubes like you know a little-bit less than an inch one stick of butter cut up let's plop it in just you-know separate them out a bit so they're-not gonna clump up in the food processor-there we go rest of the butter in and we're gonna-give this a whiz until we have like pea-sized ish pieces okay lid on pulse it a couple times nice let me show it it looks like so we have some larger chunks a lot of tiny chunks that's okay because we have to add our ice water in and we still need to have little pieces of butter so that it's nice and crispy and flaky we're gonna drizzle in some ice water I'm probably gonna have about four tablespoons so drizzle it in Hulse let's see how that looks-if you bring it together with your-fingers it comes together it's done this-is almost there but I'd like to add in-just a little bit more water sit up okay that'll be fine we're gonna dump this out onto a pastry mat now or-just a floured surface-okay let's dump this out okay this is one of my favorite parts because it looks like a crumbly disaster but it's not it's pie crust so we're not gonna-need it but you kind of want to press it-together and eat it just once or twice and then I'm gonna use my pastry mat to bring it together so just fold it and press down fold it again and press down and then do that besides two now I have my pastry dough I can add this into a plastic bag roll it out just a little bit and then let it chill for about half an hour it'll all come together and become much more pliable and coherent so into a plastic bag you go I'll be right back with the children-flour that surface flour this as well roll it out now you might have to give it a few minutes on the mat just so it-warms up because if it's too cold it'll be brittle and crack a lot so if you said happening give it a minute make sure you move the crust around as you go and if it does crack just pinch it-together don't let it rest you want to have a good margin for your pie tin you're using and now you can fold it up or roll it up whatever you like plop it back in there and here's the deal you want to push down not stretch the pie crust too much because if you stretch it-it's going to be shrinking back up when you bake right so I have a lot of excess-I'm gonna trim some away I'm not doing-like a really fancy pattern for this I think it looks beautiful rustic so what we're gonna do is is pinch it under and do a traditional thumb pinch so that-says fold this under if you notice some pieces are too long just trim them away that's perfectly functional but what we're gonna do is use our big thumb and our other thumb and index finger and this push together to create a nice little rustic pattern we have some scraps to save for later then go into-the fridge and be a delicious treat whenever you want just cover them up now-what do we do with this is then to go-into the oven at 425 but you have a-couple options I like to cover mine in tin foil after you dock it so docking is-a spoken-- some holes in and let the steam escape then it's a dock your pie crust then add in some tin foil and you can add parchment paper in between too if you'd like so the tin foil is not touching your pie crust and I'm pushing it against the-edges is basically going to prop my pie crust up this glass is really slippery-and that butter starts to melt so things start to Sag down I know it's happened-to of you before including me so this-tinfoil is this gonna help prop it up so my foil is pressed up against the edges-I'm gonna bake this at 425 for about 10-minutes remove the tinfoil brush on an egg wash redock put it back in there and-make sure it gets out golden brown my pie crust was in the oven for about 10-minutes it might have been in there for a bit longer because I was distracted-that happens it's okay here's we're gonna do an egg wash so one egg and like-a dash of cream if you want to measure it out a tablespoon now just mix it up with a fork and here's the deal take out this tinfoil did an excellent job of propping everything ups and nothing's slid let's brush this all over with the egg wash the egg wash is also gonna form a nice barrier between your chocolate mousse and the pie crust so the pie crust can stay nice and crispy I keep forgetting that you have to dock after the egg wash because the egg wash will like close those little holes back up and when I made one of these last night-it was a like a giant balloon it was so-frustrating now dock your little heart-out all those frustrations of the day you might think I'm crazy but I will be tenting this as well because now I really want that Center to brown up and not have a burnt edge so feel free to baby your pie crusts just add some foil around the sides we're gonna pop this back into the oven and just keep an eye on it I'm going to reduce the-temperature to 375 and watch until that-Center is nice and golden then remove-the foil and it'll go in for a few more minutes I'll be back once it's ready for this chocolate filling which is basically a delicious silky mousse we're adding eight eight and a half ounces of a nice dark chocolate into a glass bowl and I'm using a scale to measure it out so about nine ounces being generous now quarter cup of coffee this is gonna make-a delicious ganache but the coffee's really doesn't accentuate the chocolate flavor if you want to skip it you can go-ahead and use a quarter cup of brandy or you can just use some cream or water now we're removing this taking it onto a pot of simmering water and the water will steam heat this up the waters not gonna-touch the bowl plop it on there we're gonna let this simmer until the chocolate is mostly melted all right let's separate those eight eggs eight eggs is a lot but this is gonna make a lot of filling and I have to tell you they add so much creaminess from the yolks and fluffiness from the egg whites you are gonna be in heaven-okay eight eggs I know it's a lot but you know it's a big thing don't mix up-the egg whites and the egg yolks which is something that I as an absent-minded-Baker do all the time so egg whites egg yolks you can get a little bit of white-in the egg yolks but you cannot get any yolks in the egg white so be careful if you are clumsy like I can be you might want to separate that into a separate-bowl and then add the whites in because any yolks in here will be an issue it's an inhibit than meringue okay we're in-the homestretch people and by the way yes this dish has raw eggs in it so if you're uncomfortable with that move-along people live along there's not-going to be any alternate to this if you-want you could make like a chocolate pie with some melted chocolate ganache like we did and then you could just fold in a bunch of whipped cream and that'd be-pretty good this is going to give you a much like silkier lighter almost fluffier pie and I love that about here but there's alternates too you can make magic happen okay now we're gonna set-these whites aside for later and then concentrate on our egg yolks to this bowl I'm gonna add in 1/2 of a cup of sugar okay now we're gonna beat this in a standing mixer fitted with a paddle-attachment on high for like maybe 4-minutes until you get a really beautiful light lemony color which I'll happily-show you at the next cut so lock that in place and on high for minutes several minutes later let's take a look and you're gonna see an amazing transformation look at-this color this is like the most-beautiful pastel color that I always wished I could wear but couldn't because of my complexion okay so now this is-gonna get some beautiful chocolate added to it let's get that in there don't worry if your ganache thickens up while it's sitting around that's okay just-plop it in it's not gonna drizzle in beautifully but you know still gets in there if you check out the optional-ingredients in the blog post you'll see that you can add in brandy and an orange liqueur I love that combination for this but my husband said why does this taste disgusting what did you put in here and this is actually one of the favorite things he likes to eat so in this version I will be leaving those out also-for the children etc but those are delicious if you feel like adding those in add them in don't have brandy that's umber bin' lots of choices people okay-mix it up on the low medium high all-right let's show you what this looks-like doesn't even matter if there's a little bit unmixed at the bottom because-this will be mixed a bunch a puncheon a bunch in a bunch more that's the consistency that's the color and mmm-that taste is really nice I can taste the coffee but for me the coffee is amping up the chocolate it's not like-I'm tasting a mocha mixture okay set this aside now we're gonna be coming back to this though so leave that paddle attachment in there and let's get on to that moraine alright back to the egg-whites this time we're using a whisk attachment and you can't walk away from-this because here's the deal when you're-whisking up egg whites and it's a French meringue without all the hot sugar or-whatever happening if you over mix it-they become kind of like little flyaway brittle sad peaks and it's not really gonna be usable you want to have soft peaks that have more of a body and they're more forgiving because you're gonna be folding those into that chocolate mixture so don't walk away-okay add in like a nice pinch of salt maybe a quarter of a teaspoon and I'm using about two tablespoons of sugar just-drizzle it in fine mr. sugar now keep your eagle eyes on this and watch it until they're at the soft peak stage let's take a look at this this is one of my favorite parts of baking even if they are not horrible rancid mood you can just look at that fluff happening watch the mesmerizing spinning and it takes you away so here we have some nice fluffy clouds perfect-this will lighten that mousse up and it'll make it feel like you're eating health food even though you're just downing chocolate okay take about a quarter of this beautiful fluffy cloudy-egg white situation this floats and plop it in there so we're gonna be kind of like tempering the mixture almost you're-gonna lighten it up so when you fold the rest in it's going to be lighter and not collapse all those air bubbles so just fold it in but don't be too precious about it because most of these are gonna pop but some of them won't and then you can see it's really lightening up now if-you want it to be homogenous go ahead get that whisk out and just give it a quick whisk this tastes delicious now the rest of this goes in so look how strong that is that's the meringue just plop that in there so now fold that in so from the bottom go to the top you're basically making these circles going-into the bottom and then you're bringing that heavy stuff up folding okay once you're almost all the way there you can give it a quick whisk but don't worry-about it because if you still have to add in our whipped cream just whisk whisk whisk this is whole like light and-fluffy we're gonna set this aside now and then go back to your dirty old-meringue bowl and let's add in a cup and-a half of heavy cream for whipping this is gonna help our pie set even more and-make it silky and rich and delicious whipping cream is one of my favorite things to eat I'm a monster add in a tablespoon of sugar this recipe is kind of like sugar to taste so if you're like oh it's too sweet already don't have that sugar in you can add less the only thing you have to add the-sugar in for is the egg whites you need like a tablespoon and a half or so just-to help it whip up let's get all this out here you don't want to waste any let's put that back onto the mixer add that whisk attachment back on and let's whip it up just like with the egg whites-and this is really basic but you can't walk away from whipped cream it's like me when I ever make scrambled eggs and I get distracted I come back and it's like like a frittata and I hate frittatas so here if you over mix that whipped cream it begins to curdle and it's not gonna be silky and amazing so keep a close eye on it as soon as you get those soft peaks top oh my gosh I got distracted checking my Instagram just in the nick of time that's perfect this is what I mean by nice soft peaks-you can see here creamy delicious it's not really strong though soft last step we're folding in the whipped cream I'm so excited about this same rule as before just fold bottom to top bottom to top oh my god I could pour myself a cup-of this and just eat it and I might do that right let's give us a really quick taste just to see what it's like get a big spoonful that is heaven on a spoon-oh my gosh let's put the spoon down even though I'm gonna the whipped cream really really does a lot for this okay so you probably know this but when I make these videos I have to make like a bunch of different versions of what I'm showing you so that I can swap things out quickly because the kids have to get-up in their nap I have stuff to do comments whatever so last night I made a bunch of these pie crusts for the swap outs but I don't have all the same container so this one is like a little smaller especially for all of this-filling so just know that if you have the bigger deeper pie which is what I'm-going to swap to it's gonna be like almost a perfect amount you'll have a little cup extra-for you to snack on and I guarantee-you'll snack on it with that said let's add this in here now this is like oh oh did you see this give it a shake if you want to be a little bit extra go ahead and melt some more chocolate for a chocolate ganache and swirl it in there that'll be easy so I sculpted some cream and I was going to add it in like that-happened to have some shaved chocolate and let's just mix it up there we go-nice and creamy it's gonna pour just a little bit extra totally optional you can also add some shaped chocolate on top this is gonna go into the fridge for at least six hours maybe overnight this-is like a perfect overnight dessert to bring and I'll be right back right before serving go ahead and whip up some more whipped cream I'm gonna do about a-cup and then like a tablespoon and a half or two tablespoons of sugar a-little vanilla that's optional though but for me a chocolate pie really needs like a giant mound of whipped cream on top and that mixer it's the holidays so-you don't to worry about any of these calories add in your sugar give it a wig little vanilla and keep an eye on it-all right I see beautiful little like clouds of whipped cream let's take a look soft peaks perfect I will not be liking this because that's unsanitary but you you're gonna be tended to do that okay let's put a big mound on this and add some-shaped chocolate for the win I've cut myself a dainty little piece and I cannot wait to try it for you on camera-look at this oh it's just it is that's a crust on the bottom nice and crunchy this should be illegal oh my gosh that-is like this pure creamy chocolatey amazingness and the crust is so crispy crunchy flaky you've got to make this-this is just half to make this try it-out with a little bit of brandy some you know orange liqueur if you want so many different options even some cherry-liqueur thanks for watching hit that like button and
