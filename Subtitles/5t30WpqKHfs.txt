I've got a special visitor in the kitchen today my lovely mother Rita-hello hey she is showing us one of her favorite appetizers this is something-that we had at every dinner party growing up and people loved it there are only six ingredients and that is including pepper that's including pepper our people all right-does it come together in a snap you will want a quintuple the batch that's five-times because people just snarf these down right LD shave and they're good cold the next day too so hide some away for later don't tell anyone they're there and it's like your special little like post breakfast treat okay let's get started first step is to take our mushrooms and pop the caps off just like that I've to do is move in one direction the other they come right out press down yeah the mushroom stems we're actually gonna use or not not garbage-okay now you have a choice I'm using some nice career cheese but what else could you use good Gouda you could use-like a plain Swiss cheese right blank-space is fine but this is really good it's gonna be like a naughty taste to it-which I love yes so we're gonna grate-this up and how much do we need about well about we're gonna do the whole-thing yeah which is gonna feel vodka probably and you don't have to worry-about like getting this exactly right like measuring it out in grams no it's really just a rough proportion you could add more olives if you love the olives you could add more cheese you could even add some cream cheese to this which I think you've done haven't you yeah you-can yeah they able taste really good so you can mix some cream cheese in I think I've done that too it is really good is the variation was the care way-sis to but was the phyllo and caraway-seeds the cream cheese same good I love caraway seeds yeah me too okay so we have a nice generous portion of cheese-hop that into our bowl so you could use-shallots for this if you want but nice plain old onion is perfectly fine just minces you're not giving it like a rough chop you're really gonna give it a fine cut right so on the blog I have a French onion-soup it's a bit lighter it uses chicken stock instead of the beef stock and it has a lot of white wine and brandy oh so nice I use vegetable stock any less fine-yes a them I have a like with some nice-toast on the side mm-hmm and I sprinkle-I think it was a good career cheese on top or something but it's not that-normal casket of cheese at Auvers you have you go to a restaurant the-French onion soup this has like a pile-of cheese and if they break into it and so hard I don't I to just sprinkle it-cuz I know this is too rich that way so chop chop chop chop chop surrending up with like probably about half a couple-of more you think half a cup right into that bowl now for our olives I added my mom counted out like seven olives I think I surreptitiously added two-anymore-I think three three six nine ten is ten olives yeah but you could add more olives if you really want you don't really need that many down or you don't have to yeah you know I think if this is like a very-50s dish like a 1950's quintessentially elegant sake yeah you're using the white button mushrooms and then like the worst-richer sauce and everything else I don't-care if it's a classic I love it anyways-it watch it taste it you will really-make it one of your favorites and what I love about it is that they are so easy-to make-don't listen required the many-ingredients so and people doesn't call but when they are called out they're good to go but people love them they will go in a flash you have to make a giant batch of them it's like think about how many people you have estimate the number you want and then like triple-okay so that's Khaled's going I'll get-this in there into our Bowl writing just under a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in here with my mom's favorites I love them to you and then black pepper give me some that salt a little bit of-spice not fall because the olives and-capsule so that's plenty okay there we-go okay mix mix it up I usually use my-fingers so I can just stuff in mushrooms-yeah that's the best way to do it I-think we need more Russia sauce to bind it together a bit what do you think okay okay that's good it smells really good doesn't it and now here's the fun part-we have our mushrooms we have a void where the cap was just to take-impressible but you press it in because-you want to get it all melts into the mushroom further but you don't overfill it because then it'll all spill out so you wanted to be like nice and level but-just press it in there these will go onto a baking sheet and they're gonna broil or I bake at 450 or do you want broil setting it to broiler-ward-mm-hmm so much faster with two people-doing this I like it a lot too because-it reminds me when I was little a helping in the kitchen given a mushroom to have a little like a little membrane-around-I often peel it off just to make more room for the filling but that's optional-you don't have to do that if I have we have leftover filling I like to put it over the mushroom stems but we don't but the mushroom stems you can saute and add into them anything-enough it sets out so whatever yeah okay-pressing that in there now we can transfer this to a poet oh one left one mushroom left we're gonna put this on a baking sheet and to space them out evenly so they're not crowding each other right mm-hmm and they're gonna broil for 810 minutes until they are-golden brown-okay so broil until golden brown I-finished these off with just a sprinkling of minced parsley I just-think it makes them look a little bit more fresh and alive and I like the green he's ready to try them-yes okay absolutely-Cheers mmm that was good so good you could have added like an extra tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce if you wanted it to be more salty I've been getting less salty as I grow older just-personality-wise that's not the case-only taste wise okay make the v's if you don't like button mushrooms you can make them with cremini mushrooms you can make them with giant-Portobello just like you know the baking will be different of course but you could have a huge one too and you know enjoy if you-like my videos don't forget to hit that like button and subscribe-Bon Appetit mmm mmm
