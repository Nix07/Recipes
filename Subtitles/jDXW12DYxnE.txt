today we're making one of my all-time favorite fall treats apple-pie hand cookies these are so delicious on the-inside there's a homemade caramel with a homemade apple pie filling on top of that and it's all wrapped up in a cinnamon spiced pastry crust that is flaky and delicious if this looks like a lot of work to you and you're like no no no not today you could also make the homey version-which is equally as delicious it kind of looks like a big dumpling but it's so fast and easy to make if you liked my videos don't forget to hit that like-button and subscribe ok let's get started for the pastry crust we're starting off with three cups or 300-grams of all-purpose flour right into my food processor if you use the kitchen scale it is so easy to measure flour if-you don't you have to worry about fluffing things up or the right way and it's a whole deal but kitchen scale just dump it in slowly and 300 done now we're using a quarter cup of sugar you can use a little bit less but actually a quarter-cup isn't that much so it's not gonna be super sweet 1/2 a teaspoon of salt now for the cinnamon on the recipe I have all these spices in that crust and it is delicious but if you want it to look-kind of like more of a traditional apple pie be not so dark just use a less so-I'm gonna get mmm-half a teaspoon and a whole teaspoon of ground cinnamon that's gonna be plenty-now we take our food processor and reattach it and this wizard a few times-nice and now we can add in one cup or-two sticks of unsalted butter it has to be cold you want to have little-pea-sized granules of butter but here's the real real a lot of people but ok a little pea-sized granules of butter the butter has to be intact this is totally true it's gonna be flaky and delicious-but if you want to do any detail work like making a lattice cutting shapes doing anything fancy those butter pieces are gonna dissolve and ruin everything-so there's a trade-off if you want to do like a really rustic pie crust like I did for my pumpkin pie which you can click up here for-it'll look totally nice and be really flaky and delicious but if you want to do some detailed work and not be-frustrated you're gonna want those butter pieces to be slightly smaller not completely incorporated but smaller-they're about pea-sized now and I'm gonna add in my ice water a lot of-recipes say just one little drizzle of ice water it's not enough I don't know how they make things happen but you need a little bit more so at least two tablespoons of ice water all the way up to a quarter cup so now we're gonna add this in while we pulse tablespoons and don't tell any of the other youtubers or anybody else but I'm adding in 1/4 tablespoon we're gonna dump this out and it's gonna look like it's really like crummy not gonna work but some magic is-about to happen all right this doesn't look like dough at all what's the problem here well if you just form it together watch this that's so cool okay so this shape it together with your hands we're gonna-knead it just a couple times to bring it together and it's gonna rest in the fridge for like 20 minutes to half an hour or overnight if you're doing this-in stages which I always recommend if you have kids or are busy and then it'll rest and come together into a disc-that's really nice and workable but it's in a plastic bag get all that dough off your fingers don't eat it all because-you need it for your pie crust before I roll this out I want to bring something to your attention if you want to do like-a nice lattice design or have the pie crust be a little thick make a double batch you don't need to double the caramel this makes a lot of caramel and-you don't need to double the filling it makes enough filling for about 12 or so take this we're going to roll it out-just a little bit with our rolling pin-to give it a head start now I can seal this transfer this to a fridge let it-rest and then while that's happening-we're going to be making our caramel and our apple pie filling never use store-bought filling it's not cool for-the filling I'm using about 3 pounds of-Honey Crisp apples because-favorite but they're pretty pricey so you can use any Apple that you like except a Red Delicious because nobody should like those apples okay start off by peeling them doesn't have to be a perfect peel but it should be you don't-have your apples Brown while you peel-them go ahead and just pop them into a bowl of some cold water with a little-bit of lemon juice and that'll keep them nice and bright once your apples repealed you're gonna slice the flesh away from the core didn't give them like a nice just nice slice you'll be chopping up the finished apple pie filling at the end of this because these cookies are pretty small-and you want to have the bite-sized-Apple pieces not huge slices of Apple-it'll make everything nicer and the lattice will rest more evenly on that-chopped up pie filling now I'm gonna dump these apples into a bowl I'm adding-the juice of a lemon kind of optional but I think what makes an apple pie great besides the apples and the pastry-and everything else is the zing of a lemon my mom will do this with a little-bit of lemon zest too but I'm just gonna add the juice these apples are sweet but-there's always room for more sugar so-I'm adding in two thirds of a cup of granulated sugar you can reduce that down to half a cup or 1/3 if you like things to be a little bit more tart less sweet healthy pinch of nutmeg it is the holidays and then 1/2 a teaspoon or so-of ground cinnamon mmm when you use my clean hands and give this a toss to distribute those ingredients and this could be like the perfect snack but I'm-gonna cook it down and make it real tasty for you I'm adding my prepared-apple mixture into a pan with 4-tablespoons of melted butter over like medium heat cook it down until that sugar melts once the sugars melted we're gonna cover it up and cook on medium low for about maybe 10 minutes homemade caramel is one of the simpler pleasures in life and I cannot recommend it highly enough so easy 1 cup of dark brown sugar-half a cup of heavy cream I'm using half a teaspoon of salt and then there is a tablespoon of the but I'm gonna put that in at the end I'm gonna whisk this up just really quickly-okay now it already looks kind of caramely but we have to raise that-temperature up so we're gonna cook it-over medium issues stir the stir stir this you're gonna see bubbles forming on the outside then on the inside and those bubbles will become larger as this thickens up once thick you will know it-you can use the back of a wooden spoon-and swipe along but it's gonna become very clear this has thickened up considerably when it's cooked-all right caramels all thickened up I'm gonna transfer it to a large ishbal so it can cool down more quickly we're gonna use it fairly soon look at that drip oh this stuff is like liquid heaven-but don't touch it it's super hot be careful my apples are perfectly soft so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna add this into a colander over a bowl to separate the apples from the juices because the apples are done but those juices need to get thickened up this smells so good by the way-well shake all those juices out you can move the apples around a bit transfer those juices back into the pan and we're-gonna cook this down over medium heat-again until this becomes like a-delicious apple caramel toss that with the apples again and everything is gonna be nice and perfect for these apple pie cookies I actually made a couple different versions of this dough this is the one I made for you just a little while ago with like that-1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon this one has all the spices in the blog recipe including the full amount of cinnamon-and it makes a big difference this looks like whole wheat dough to me though so-I'm like me not so attractive but when you cook it up and add the egg wash on you won't be able to tell the difference-at all and it'll be nice and spicy and delicious anyways I'm going to use the lighter version though so start off with the pastry mat and then add a nice sprinkle of flour if your pastry dough is cracking it might be a little bit too-cold you can fix it by pinching it-together but you know feel free to let it warm up for just a little bit longer-add this onto your pastry mat sprinkle a little bit more flour you don't want it-sticking to the rolling pin now we're gonna roll it out-then after you roll each time check for-cracks pinch them together if you see any and then move it don't let the dough stay in the same-place for too long because it will end up sticking pinch pinch pinch pinch pinch pinch pinch if you have a tear just pinch it together like that that solves most of your problems for these apple pie cookies I'm using a circular cookie cutter get a set of-these I have a concentric circle set so there's tiny little ones all the way to this is the largest size and they come in handy all the time I use the-Oh cut your shapes out si released from the pastry mat because I was moving it along and it was floured don't let that pastry dough stick it'll make you really sad we're gonna transfer these onto a baking sheet with a Silpat if you don't have a Silpat don't worry just use some parchment paper and you'll be a-okay make sure to give yourself a little bit-of space on the baking sheet because-you're actually gonna be assembling-directly on the baking sheet and cleaning things up directly on the baking sheets so you-don't be too crowded now you have like some nice pristine pastry and then all these little scraps the scraps risen to gather up and then later on we'll be rolling it all together to make more pristine pastry it's not trash we're gonna cut our strips now so just eyeball it with a ruler you want nice straight strips but the width is totally up to you I usually cut ones that are about-1/2 an inch thick to make this all work for the assembly use an egg wash I'm not going to show you on camera but an egg wash is just an egg a tablespoon of cream mix it up and then you brush it on and it's a beautiful glue for pastry and it makes everything this gorgeous golden color don't overdo it though you don't-want to go crazy I have my caramel it's really thick but that's totally fine I'm going to add it into the center like a nice gloop feel free to spread it out during baking it will definitely even out use too so you don't have to worry about having like a perfect disc of caramel in the center ok I have a lot of extra caramel-leftover bottle it up you use it for later it is good on cakes in your mouth everywhere now we're gonna add that apple pie filling in and don't go crazy-I know you want like pile it up to the sky but it will does moves out so you know a tablespoon and a half is the perfect amount so it's add in that dollop there if it spills out don't worry it's gonna get a little bit messy-I'm warning you okay I did another tablespoon there-I'm so excited to eat these like can't even tell you I don't know if it comes-across in the close-up shot but this is bonkers here's where it gets a little bit messy and you're definitely gonna be rolling out this scrap fabric and maybe-even using a second batch of dough depending on how many strips you want to put on the more strips I think it looks the more pretty but you're also using more pastry so life is a balance so let's add that first strip on here one cut that piece off that gets put to the-edge - it's looking cute already and here is where I the forgetful Baker all of us forget to do the egg wash because-you want to egg wash this first layer-and then put the second part of the lattice on so it sticks together now we're ready for the other part of the lattice so number one number two look how pretty that looks already and number four all right so what about the edges you're not going to cut it away with a knife that's gonna be a bit messy and crazy so we're gonna use that cookie cutter again and just go pop clean it all up and look perfect alright so a plop that cookie cutter down clear the excess scraps away which will probably-later and carefully bring it back up there that looks nice last step final egg wash over the top layer and we're gonna finish this off with a sprinkling of sugar to catch the light that was just enough pastry to do my six cookies but I made extra and I will show you how-to make the easy-peasy dumpling version of this so fast and simple but maybe not as pretty as this apple pie hand cookie final dusting of sugar light dusting people now at this we're going to go-into the oven at 350 you could also do like 375 for mmm 20 minutes or so I'll put the correct time into subtitles but it's until these are nice and golden brown golden so make sure you put it in one way half like after ten minutes switch it around I know my oven is a litte warm in the back but if yours-perfectly cooks don't worry about that-all right into the other those guys are in the oven but while they're baking up let me show you how to make those-dumplings so easy and fast I know you're busy but everyone likes delicious things-cut a circle out if you don't have a circle cutter just do a rough cut this-is all you're gonna use let's add in a little bit of caramel just pop that in there so add in a less than a tablespoon or depending on the size just don't overfill now use an egg wash run it around the edge this is the glue is-gonna hold it together so you want to have like a nice seal and now just fold it over just like that if it breaks like-mine just did it's okay because you're gonna bake this up and it's kind of gonna lose everywhere it's not gonna have the best structural integrity but that's it pop some holes in there and then brush-it with an egg wash and if you want you-can sprinkle it with some sugar and-you're done much faster it'll be equally delicious I promise and it'll be a little too easy don't worry about that if you want to make it look nicer have at it I'm so torn you're so beautiful you are so easy they're both delicious I have to show you this pie filling coming through in the lattice it is like translucent and caramel colored-it's screams fall and the smell is-divine I'm gonna photograph these though so you get eaten first just personified these that they were living creatures even though they're food okay whoa oh my god this pie crust-is so flaky it dissolves in your mouth and that caramel just melted with the apple pie filling Oh this
