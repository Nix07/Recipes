hey bakers John canal from preppy kitchen here today we're gonna be making this delicious super quick avocado salad with tons of fresh citrus creamy dreamy burrata and a couple other things that I-guarantee you'll love let's get started first off imma mince like maybe a couple tablespoons of shallot this is optional-you could use garlic you could use onion or you could skip it all together but I just love the taste it gives a little-bit of bite let's add that into our little mason jar okay as well as you can-and now let's add in a quarter cup of-vinegar I'm using a blackberry vinegar-cuz thought this is a gift and it's really tasty but anything is fine there we go and while we're at it I'm gonna add in a few time leaves just rip them-up and let that all infuse while I work on the rest of my prep there we go okay set that aside now for the avocados I am horrible at choosing avocados I know you supposed to feel them and make sure they yield a little bit and then you can lift the stem up and if it's super green it's-not ripe if it's less green you have a better chance but I think cutting into them is the best way so let's see so exciting I'm very happy about this-alright this I will set aside later I don't want it to brown in the meantime let's get some premiums of grapefruit orange and blood orange okay to get a premium we're gonna start off by removing a skin including the pith so pretty I love the color continue that process now use your knife and just cut inside of the membranes so all you're-left with is that premium of beautiful citrus continue this process for all the citrus fruits you're using and you'll have a basket full of joy or a bunch of-premiums for your salad and the membranes have a ton of juice on them and are delicious I love snacking on it makes me happy if you want to make the salad but you don't have like access-to blood oranges or grapefruits or oranges just use any kind of citrus that-you enjoy-I think the grapefruits add a really nice kind of acidic bite to them and the oranges are pretty so you can use one type of orange or you can skip the oranges all together if you're minding your sugar this recipe calls for three tablespoons of orange juice in the-dressing but today I'm just going to let all these juices from my premium ink them into the dressing get that okay-this is not trash this is delicious so-don't throw it away oh look at this it's-so funny because sometimes for a blood orange you totally get cheated and it's like a regular orange like a little tiny bit of like a speck of red in it but sometimes you get these beautiful colored ones I mean look at this color-oh my gosh it's so beautiful blood oranges taste very similar to a regular orange by the way we have anything there are less acidic and have a milder taste in my opinion now if you want instead of doing the whole premium thing is really-pretty to take little slices after-you've removed the skin and pith and these look beautiful in your salad laid on top it's also quicker and less juice wasteful so you can have a combination-see that looks wonderful it catches the light little jewels last one I have a cara cara orange so I looked crazy at the grocery store yesterday cuz I had a-giant bag full of citrus I'm shooting a-lot of orange and grapefruit things today so maybe they thought I was healthy listen to cut this directly and I would like to have some of these slice again-and you can cut the slices in half so-they're more of a nice bite size-remember a sharp knife is a safe knife with a sharp knife you know what you're-getting like okay can slice through-things like butter including my fingers so you have better control over it with a dull knife you're kind of like hacking into things and that's when the dangerous part happens that's where those cheese graters are such an issue-oh my gosh because they're not very sharp and your head is like sighing away so nice all those citruses have a really distinct flavor I have a few Tomatoes here they're gonna provide a nice little earthy garden punch if you don't like-tomatoes leave them out I didn't come around to rob Tomatoes until I was like well into my 20s so I get it I'm cutting-little slices just you can be mindful of-like what will fit onto a fork there we go now for our avocado and we're almost-done so fast I'm gonna use two or three-avocados in this and go totally hog wild crazy I love avocados they're so creamy-my kids are also obsessed with them so I-rarely get to eat them they always just like wolf them down right away with the worst job of healing ever-trying to a pretty job peeling so I can have nice slices of avocado this one Oh-what happened there we go it's so-beautiful I love that one more if you're in a rush you can make this salad so quick I just like chopping the heck out of everything it doesn't have to look-pretty the taste is beautiful avocados are naked let's slice them up and I'm gonna-reserve one half for the garnish on top-just to make it look really pretty okay we can place this in here along with-clean wave I'm adding in a few handfuls-of leaves also known as salad greens you can give them a little bit of a rip if they're kind of large I would recommend-either mixed greens butter lettuce or some spring greens I'm gonna finish up my dressing now I have a quarter cup of vinegar and a few tablespoons of minced or roughly chopped scale these called shallots so I have a quarter cup of-vinegar and a few tablespoons of minced or finely chopped scallops shallots and-I'm adding in a quarter cup of olive oil good amount of pepper like maybe half a teaspoon of salt you can add some more-salt to taste after you give this a good-mix don't think I forgot that citrus-there we go mostly in there good job John give us a good shake to emulsify we're gonna mix this up with my clean hands just a little bit now we're gonna transfer it into my serving bowl and finish the presentation this is so good-I cannot wait to try it this is enough like two people if you're having-something else for lunch or just for you-I'm sprinkling in half a cup of garbanzo-beans I love chickpeas they're really-healthy they have a lot of flavor very-creamy and protein take some of that reserved avocado and spread it around you can also bring in to the front some of those beautiful citrus pieces so-people can see what's in this wonderful-salad the finishing touch on my already-beautiful salad is amazing burrata if you haven't had burrata it's like mozzarella and heavy whipping cream had a baby you buy them in these-little like milk baths basically and it looks like a fresh mozzarella but the little nib feels like mozzarella on the inside it's all it's all full of that jiggly-wiggly curd this stuff makes me more excited than it should but what you're going to do is cut it open and this break it up into a few pieces it's very dramatic when you cut it up and-Okla all kind of like explodes out you see on the inside it's like molten cream I don't know how to describe it it's very decadent so if you want this to be a healthy lunch salad you would skip the burrata but you know you only-live once so last little bit is our dressing I'm in heaven I cannot wait look at this this is some warm weather magic I love it this salad is beyond it was so easy to-make and if you'd like some more texture you can add croutons or serve it with like a wonderful French bread oh okay the shallots added so much extra like crunch and bite just perfect even though-there's only a couple tablespoons in there and my god the burrata and avocado makes this creamy and so luxurious if you like this recipe check out my fish tacos they are so crunchy creamy delicious even though my avocados were not ripe and that made me very sad it's still good though for something totally different but still vegetarian check out my spanakopita video it's a Greek spinach pie and it is fantastic you will
